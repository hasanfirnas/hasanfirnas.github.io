## 1 Introduction and PCI Data Security Standard Overview

```
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) was developed to encourage and enhance payment card account data security
and facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures globally. PCI DSS provides a baseline of technical and operational
requirements designed to protect account data. While specifically designed to focus on environments with payment card account data, PCI
DSS can also be used to protect against threats and secure other elements in the payment ecosystem.
```

This document, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Requirements and Testing Procedures, consists of the 12 PCI DSS
principal requirements, detailed security requirements, corresponding testing procedures, and other information pertinent to each requirement.
The following sections provide detailed guidelines and best practices to assist entities to prepare for, conduct, and report the results of a PCI
DSS assessment. The PCI DSS requirements and testing procedures begin on page 43.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
PCI DSS comprises a minimum set of requirements for protecting account data and may be enhanced by additional controls and practices to
further mitigate risks, and to incorporate local, regional, and sector laws and regulations. Additionally, legislation or regulatory requirements
may require specific protection of personal information or other data elements (for example, cardholder name).
```
**_Limitations_**

If any of the requirements contained in this standard conflict with country, state, or local laws, the country, state, or local law will apply.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

## 2 PCI DSS Applicability Information

```
PCI DSS is intended for all entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data (CHD) and/or sensitive authentication data (SAD) or could
impact the security of the cardholder data environment (CDE). This includes all entities involved in payment card account processing —
including merchants, processors, acquirers, issuers, and other service providers.
```
```
Whether any entity is required to comply with or validate their compliance to PCI DSS is at the discretion of those organizations that manage
compliance programs (such as payment brands and acquirers). Contact the organizations of interest for any additional criteria.
```
### Defining Account Data, Cardholder Data, and Sensitive Authentication Data

```
Cardholder data and sensitive authentication data are considered account data and are defined as follows:
```
**Table 2. Account Data**

```
Account Data
```
```
Cardholder Data includes: Sensitive Authentication Data includes:
```
- Primary Account Number (PAN)
- Cardholder Name
- Expiration Date
- Service Code
    - Full track data (magnetic-stripe data or equivalent on a chip)
    - Card verification code
    - PINs/PIN blocks

```
PCI DSS requirements apply to entities with environments where account data (cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data) is stored,
processed, or transmitted, and entities with environments that can impact the security of the CDE. Some PCI DSS requirements may also
apply to entities with environments that do not store, process, or transmit account data – for example, entities that outsource payment
operations or management of their CDE^1. Entities that outsource their payment environments or payment operations to third parties remain
responsible for ensuring that the account data is protected by the third party per applicable PCI DSS requirements.
```
```
The primary account number (PAN) is the defining factor for cardholder data. The term account data therefore covers the following: the full
PAN, any other elements of cardholder data that are present with the PAN, and any elements of sensitive authentication data.
```
(^1) In accordance with those organizations that manage compliance programs (such as payment brands and acquirers); entities should contact the organizations of
interest for more details.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
If cardholder name, service code, and/or expiration date are stored, processed, or transmitted with the PAN, or are otherwise present in the
CDE, they must be protected in accordance with the PCI DSS requirements applicable to cardholder data.
```
```
If an entity stores, processes, or transmits PAN, then a CDE exists to which PCI DSS requirements will apply. Some requirements may not be
applicable, for example if the entity does not store PAN, then the requirements relating to the protection of stored PAN in Requirement 3 will
not be applicable to the entity.
```
```
Even if an entity does not store, process, or transmit PAN, some PCI DSS requirements may still apply. Consider the following:
```
```
 If the entity stores SAD, requirements specifically related to SAD storage in Requirement 3 will be applicable.
```
```
 If the entity engages third-party service providers to store, process or transmit PAN on its behalf, requirements related to the
management of service providers in Requirement 12 will be applicable.
```
```
 If the entity can impact the security of a CDE because the security of an entity’s infrastructure can affect how cardholder data is
processed (for example, via a web server that controls the generation of a payment form or page) some requirements will be applicable.
```
```
 If cardholder data is only present on physical media (for example paper), requirements relating to the security and disposal of physical
media in Requirement 9 will be applicable.
```
```
 Requirements related to an incident response plan are applicable to all entities, to ensure that there are procedures to follow in the
event of a suspected or actual breach of the confidentiality of cardholder data.
```
**_Use of Account Data, Sensitive Authentication Data, Cardholder Data, and Primary Account Number in PCI DSS_**

```
PCI DSS includes requirements that specifically refer to account data, cardholder data, and sensitive authentication data. It is important
to note that each of these types of data are different and the terms are not interchangeable. Specific references within requirements to
account data, cardholder data, or sensitive authentication data are purposeful, and the requirements apply specifically to the type of
data that is referenced.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

**_Elements of Account Data and Storage Requirements_**

```
Table 3 identifies the elements of cardholder and sensitive authentication data, whether storage of each data element is permitted or
prohibited, and whether each data element must be rendered unreadable—for example, with strong cryptography—when stored. This
table is not exhaustive and is presented to illustrate only how the stated requirements apply to the different data elements.
```

```
Yes, data stored until authorization is
complete must be protected with strong
cryptography as defined in Requirement
3.3.
```
```
Card verification code
```
```
PIN/PIN Block
```
```
If PAN is stored with other elements of cardholder data, only the PAN must be rendered unreadable according to PCI DSS Requirement 3.5.1.
```
```
Sensitive authentication data must not be stored after authorization, even if encrypted. This applies even for environments where there is no
PAN present.
```
(^2) Where data exists in the same environment as PAN.
(^3) Except as permitted for issuers and companies that support issuing services. Requirements for issuers and issuing services are separately defined in
Requirement 3.3.3.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

## 3 Relationship between PCI DSS and PCI SSC Software Standards

```
PCI SSC supports the use of secure payment software within cardholder data environments (CDE) via the Payment Application Data Security
Standard (PA-DSS) and the Software Security Framework (SSF), which consists of the Secure Software Standard and the Secure Software
Lifecycle (Secure SLC) Standard. Software that is PCI SSC validated and listed provides assurance that the software has been developed
using secure practices and has met a defined set of software security requirements.
```
```
The PCI SSC secure software programs include listings of payment software and software
vendors that have been validated as meeting the applicable PCI SSC Software Standards.
```
```
 Validated Software : Payment software listed on the PCI SSC website as a
Validated Payment Application (PA-DSS) or Validated Payment Software (the
Secure Software Standard) has been evaluated by a qualified assessor to confirm
the software meets the security requirements within that standard. The security
requirements in these standards are focused on protecting the integrity and
confidentiality of payment transactions and account data.
```
```
 Validated Software Vendors : The Secure SLC Standard defines security
requirements for software vendors to integrate secure software development
practices throughout the entire software lifecycle. Software vendors that have been
validated as meeting the Secure SLC Standard are listed on the PCI SSC website
as a Secure SLC Qualified Vendor.
```
```
For more information about the SSF or PA-DSS, refer to the respective Program Guides at http://www.pcisecuritystandards.org.
```
```
All software that stores, processes, or transmits account data, or that could impact the security of account data or a CDE, is in scope for an
entity’s PCI DSS assessment. While the use of validated payment software supports the security of an entity’s CDE, the use of such software
does not by itself make an entity PCI DSS compliant. The entity’s PCI DSS assessment should include verification that the software is properly
configured and securely implemented to support applicable PCI DSS requirements. Additionally, if PCI-listed payment software has been
customized, a more in-depth review will be required during the PCI DSS assessment because the software may no longer be representative of
the version that was originally validated.
```
```
Because security threats are constantly evolving, software that is no longer supported by the vendor (for example, identified by the vendor as
“end of life”) may not offer the same level of security as supported versions. Entities are strongly encouraged to keep their software current
and updated to the latest software versions available.
```
```
Entities that develop their own software are encouraged to refer to PCI SSC’s software security standards and consider the requirements
therein as best practices to use in their development environments. Secure payment software implemented in a PCI DSS compliant
environment will help minimize the potential for security breaches leading to compromises of account data and fraud. See Bespoke and
Custom Software.
```
```
Note: PA-DSS and the related program will be
retired in October 2022. Refer to the PCI SSC
List of Validated Payment Applications for
expiry dates for PA-DSS validated
applications. After the expiry date, applications
are listed as “Acceptable only for Pre-Existing
Deployments.” Whether an entity can continue
to use a PA-DSS application with an expired
listing is at the discretion of organizations that
manage compliance programs (such as
payment brands and acquirers); entities should
contact the organizations of interest for more
details.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

### Applicability of PCI DSS to Payment Software Vendors

```
PCI DSS may apply to a payment software vendor if the vendor is also a service provider that stores, processes, or transmits account
data, or has access to their customers’ account data—for example, in the role of a payment service provider or via remote access to a
customer environment. Software vendors to which PCI DSS may be applicable include those offering payment services, as well as cloud
service providers offering payment terminals in the cloud, software as a service (SaaS), e-commerce in the cloud, and other cloud
payment services.
```
### Bespoke and Custom Software

```
All bespoke and custom software that stores, processes, or transmits
account data, or that could impact the security of account data or a CDE,
is in scope for an entity’s PCI DSS assessment.
```
```
Bespoke and custom software that has been developed and maintained
in accordance with one of PCI SSC’s Software Security Framework
standards (the Secure Software Standard or the Secure SLC standard)
will support an entity in meeting PCI DSS Requirement 6.
```
```
See Appendix F for more details.
```
```
Note: PCI DSS Requirement 6 fully applies to bespoke
and custom software that has not been developed and
maintained in accordance with one of PCI SSC’s Software
Security Framework standards. Entities that use software
vendors to develop bespoke or custom software that
could impact the security of account data or their CDE are
responsible for ensuring those software vendors develop
the software according to PCI DSS Requirement 6.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

## 4 Scope of PCI DSS Requirements

```
PCI DSS requirements apply to:
```
```
 The cardholder data environment (CDE), which is comprised of:
```
- System components, people, and processes that store, process, and transmit cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data,
    and,
- System components that may not store, process, or transmit CHD/SAD but have unrestricted connectivity to system components
    that store, process, or transmit CHD/SAD.

```
AND
```
```
 System components, people, and processes that could impact the security of the CDE.^4
```
```
“System components” include network devices, servers, computing devices, virtual components, cloud components, and software. Examples
of system components include but are not limited to:
```
```
 Systems that store, process, or transmit account data (for example, payment terminals, authorization systems, clearing systems,
payment middleware systems, payment back-office systems, shopping cart and store front systems, payment gateway/switch systems,
fraud monitoring systems).
```
```
 Systems that provide security services (for example, authentication servers, access control servers, security information and event
management (SIEM) systems, physical security systems (for example, badge access or CCTV), multi-factor authentication systems,
anti-malware systems).
```
```
 Systems that facilitate segmentation (for example, internal network security controls).
```
```
 Systems that could impact the security of account data or the CDE (for example, name resolution, or e-commerce (web) redirection
servers).
```
```
 Virtualization components such as virtual machines, virtual switches/routers, virtual appliances, virtual applications/desktops, and
hypervisors.
```
```
 Cloud infrastructure and components, both external and on premises, and including instantiations of containers or images, virtual private
clouds, cloud-based identity and access management, CDEs residing on premises or in the cloud, service meshes with containerized
applications, and container orchestration tools.
```
(^4) For additional guidance, refer to _Information Supplement: Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation_ on the PCI SSC website.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
 Network components, including but not limited to network security controls, switches, routers, VoIP network devices, wireless access
points, network appliances, and other security appliances.
```
```
 Server types, including but not limited to web, application, database, authentication, mail, proxy, Network Time Protocol (NTP), and
Domain Name System (DNS).
```
```
 End-user devices, such as computers, laptops, workstations, administrative workstations, tablets, and mobile devices.
```
```
 Printers, and multi-function devices that scan, print, and fax.
```
```
 Storage of account data in any format (for example, paper, data files, audio files, images, and video recordings).
```
```
 Applications, software, and software components, serverless applications, including all purchased, subscribed (for example, Software-
as-a-Service), bespoke and custom software, including internal and external (for example, Internet) applications.
```
```
 Tools, code repositories, and systems that implement software configuration management or for deployment of objects to the CDE or to
systems that can impact the CDE.
```

```
Figure 1 shows considerations for scoping system components for PCI DSS.
```
**Figure 1. Understanding PCI DSS Scoping**


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

### Annual PCI DSS Scope Confirmation

```
The first step in preparing for a PCI DSS assessment is for the entity to accurately determine the scope of the review. The assessed entity
must confirm the accuracy of their PCI DSS scope according to PCI DSS Requirement 12.5.2 by identifying all locations and flows of account
data, and identifying all systems that are connected to or, if compromised, could impact the CDE (for example, authentication servers, remote
access servers, logging servers) to ensure they are included in the PCI DSS scope. All types of systems and locations should be considered
during the scoping process, including backup/recovery sites and fail-over systems.
```
```
The minimum steps for an entity to confirm the accuracy of their PCI DSS scope are specified in PCI DSS Requirement 12.5.2. The entity is
expected to retain documentation to show how PCI DSS scope was determined. The documentation is retained for assessor review and for
reference during the entity’s next PCI DSS scope confirmation activity. For each PCI DSS assessment, the assessor validates that the entity
accurately defined and documented the scope of the assessment.
```
```
Note : This annual confirmation of PCI DSS scope is defined at PCI DSS Requirement at 12.5.2 and is an activity expected to be performed by
the entity. This activity is not the same, nor is it intended to be replaced by, the scoping confirmation performed by the entity’s assessor during
the assessment.
```
### Segmentation

```
Segmentation (or isolation) of the CDE from the remainder of an entity’s network is not a PCI DSS requirement. However, it is strongly
recommended as a method that may reduce the:
```
```
 Scope of the PCI DSS assessment
```
```
 Cost of the PCI DSS assessment
```
```
 Cost and difficulty of implementing and maintaining PCI DSS controls
```
```
 Risk to an organization relative to payment card account data (reduced by consolidating that data into fewer, more controlled locations)
```
```
Without adequate segmentation (sometimes called a "flat network"), the entire network is in scope for the PCI DSS assessment. Segmentation
can be achieved using a number of physical or logical methods, such as properly configured internal network security controls, routers with
strong access control lists, or other technologies that restrict access to a particular segment of a network. To be considered out of scope for
PCI DSS, a system component must be properly segmented (isolated) from the CDE, such that the out-of-scope system component could not
impact the security of the CDE, even if that component was compromised.
```
```
An important prerequisite to reduce the scope of the CDE is a clear understanding of business needs and processes related to the storage,
processing, and transmission of account data. Restricting account data to as few locations as possible by eliminating unnecessary data and
consolidating necessary data may require reengineering of long-standing business practices.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Documenting account data flows via a data-flow diagram helps an entity fully understand how account data comes into an organization, where
it resides within the organization, and how it traverses through various systems within the organization. Data-flow diagrams also illustrate all
locations where account data is stored, processed, and transmitted. This information supports an entity implementing segmentation and can
also support confirming that segmentation is being used to isolate the CDE from out-of-scope networks.
```
```
If segmentation is used to reduce the scope of the PCI DSS assessment, the assessor must verify that the segmentation is adequate to
reduce the scope of the assessment, as illustrated in Figure 2. At a high level, adequate segmentation isolates systems that store, process, or
transmit account data from those that do not. However, the adequacy of a specific segmentation implementation is highly variable and
depends on several factors such as a given network's configuration, the technologies deployed, and other controls that may be implemented.
```
**Figure 2. Segmentation and Impact to PCI DSS Scope**


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

### Wireless

```
If wireless technology is used to store, process, or transmit account data (for example, wireless point-of-sale devices), or if a wireless local
area network (WLAN) is part of or connected to the CDE, the PCI DSS requirements and testing procedures for securing wireless
environments apply and must be performed.
```
```
Rogue wireless detection must be performed per PCI DSS Requirement 11.2.1 even when wireless is not used within the CDE and the entity
has a policy that prohibits the use of wireless technology within its environment. This is because of the ease with which a wireless access
point can be attached to a network, the difficulty in detecting its presence, and the increased risk presented by unauthorized wireless devices.
```
```
Before wireless technology is implemented, an entity should carefully evaluate the need for the technology against the risk. Consider
deploying wireless technology only for non-sensitive data transmission.
```
### Encrypted Cardholder Data and Impact on PCI DSS Scope

```
Encryption of cardholder data with strong cryptography is an acceptable method of rendering the data unreadable according to PCI DSS
Requirement 3.5. However, encryption alone is generally insufficient to render the cardholder data out of scope for PCI DSS and does not
remove the need for PCI DSS in that environment. The entity’s environment is still in scope for PCI DSS due to the presence of cardholder
data. For example, for a merchant card-present environment, there is physical access to the payment cards to complete a transaction and
there may also be paper reports or receipts with cardholder data. Similarly, in merchant card-not-present environments, such as mail-
order/telephone-order and e-commerce, payment card details are provided via channels that need to be evaluated and protected according to
PCI DSS.
```
```
The following are each in scope for PCI DSS:
```
```
 Systems performing encryption and/or decryption of cardholder data, and systems performing key management functions,
```
```
 Encrypted cardholder data that is not isolated from the encryption and decryption and key management processes,
```
```
 Encrypted cardholder data that is present on a system or media that also contains the decryption key,
```
```
 Encrypted cardholder data that is present in the same environment as the decryption key,
```
```
 Encrypted cardholder data that is accessible to an entity that also has access to the decryption key.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Note : A PCI-listed P2PE solution can significantly reduce the number of PCI DSS requirements applicable to a merchant’s cardholder data
environment. However, it does not completely remove the applicability of PCI DSS in the merchant environment.
```
### Encrypted Cardholder Data and Impact to PCI DSS Scope for Third-Party Service Providers

```
Where a third-party service provider (TPSP) receives and/or stores only data encrypted by another entity, and where they do not have the
ability to decrypt the data, the TPSP may be able to consider the encrypted data out of scope if certain conditions are met. This is because
responsibility for the data generally remains with the entity, or entities, with the ability to decrypt the data or impact the security of the
encrypted data. Determining which party is responsible for specific PCI DSS controls will depend on several factors, including who has access
to the decryption keys, the role performed by each party, and the agreement between parties. Responsibilities should be clearly defined and
documented to ensure both the TPSP and the entity providing the encrypted data understand which entity is responsible for which security
controls.
```
```
As an example, a TPSP providing storage services receives and stores encrypted cardholder data provided by customers for back-up
purposes. This TPSP does not have access to the encryption or decryption keys, nor does it perform any key management for its customers.
The TPSP can exclude any such encrypted data when determining its PCI DSS scope. However, the TPSP does maintain responsibility for
controlling access to the encrypted data storage as part of its service agreements with its customers.
```
```
Responsibility for ensuring that the encrypted data and the cryptographic keys are protected according to applicable PCI DSS requirements is
often shared between entities. In the above example, the customer determines which of their personnel are authorized to access the storage
media, and the storage facility is responsible for managing the physical and/or logical access controls to ensure that only persons authorized
by the customer are granted access to the storage media. The specific PCI DSS requirements applicable to a TPSP will depend on the
services provided and the agreement between the two parties. In the example of a TPSP providing storage services, the physical and logical
access controls provided by the TPSP will need to be reviewed at least annually. This review could be performed as part of the merchant’s
PCI DSS assessment or, alternatively, the review could be performed, and controls validated, by the TPSP with appropriate evidence provided
to the merchant. For information about “appropriate evidence,” see Options for TPSPs to Validate PCI DSS Compliance for TPSP Services
that Meet Customers’ PCI DSS Requirements.
```
```
As another example, a TPSP that receives only encrypted cardholder data for the purposes of routing to other entities, and that does not have
access to the data or cryptographic keys, may not have any PCI DSS responsibility for that encrypted data. In this scenario, where the TPSP
is not providing any security services or access controls, they may be considered the same as a public or untrusted network, and it would be
the responsibility of the entity(s) sending/receiving account data through the TPSP’s network to ensure PCI DSS controls are applied to
protect the data being transmitted.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

### Use of Third-Party Service Providers

```
An entity (referred to as the “customer” in this section) might choose to use a third-party service provider (TPSP) to store, process, or transmit
account data or to manage in-scope system components on the customer’s behalf. Use of a TPSP may have an impact on the security of a
customer’s CDE.
```
```
Note : Use of a PCI DSS compliant TPSP does not make a customer PCI DSS compliant, nor does it remove the customer’s responsibility for
its own PCI DSS compliance. Even if a customer uses a TPSP to meet all account data functions, that customer remains responsible for
confirming its own compliance as requested by organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment brands and
acquirers). Customers should contact the organizations of interest for any requirements.
```
**_Using TPSPs and the Impact on Customers Meeting PCI DSS Requirement 12._**

```
There are many different scenarios where a customer might use one or more TPSPs for functions within or related to the customer’s
CDE. In all scenarios where a TPSP is used, the customer must manage and oversee the PCI DSS compliance status of all their TPSPs
in accordance with Requirement 12.8, including TPSPs that:
```
```
 Have access to the customer’s CDE,
```
```
 Manage in-scope system components on the customer’s behalf, and/or
```
```
 Can impact the security of the customer’s CDE.
```
```
Managing TPSPs in accordance with Requirement 12.8 includes performing due diligence, having appropriate agreements in place,
identifying which requirements apply to the customer and which apply to the TPSP, and monitoring the compliance status of TPSPs at
least annually.
```
```
Requirement 12.8 does not specify that the customer’s TPSPs must be PCI DSS compliant, only that the customer monitor their
compliance status as specified in the requirement. Therefore, a TPSP does not need to be PCI DSS compliant for its customer to meet
Requirement 12.8.
```
**_Impact of Using TPSPs for Services that Meet Customers’ PCI DSS Requirements_**

```
When the TPSP provides a service that meets a PCI DSS requirement(s) on the customer’s behalf or where that service may impact the
security of the customer’s CDE, then those requirements are in scope for the customer’s assessment and the compliance of that service
will impact the customer’s PCI DSS compliance. The TPSP must demonstrate it meets applicable PCI DSS requirements for those
requirements to be in place for its customers. For example, if an entity engages a TPSP to manage its network security controls, and the
TPSP does not provide evidence that it meets the applicable requirements in PCI DSS Requirement 1, then those requirements are not
in place for the customer’s assessment. As another example, TPSPs that store backups of cardholder data on behalf of customers
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
would need to meet the applicable requirements related to access controls, physical security, etc., for their customers to consider those
requirements in place for their assessments.
```
**_Importance of Understanding Responsibilities Between TPSP Customers and TPSPs_**

```
Customers and TPSPs should clearly identify and understand the following:
```
```
 The services and system components included in the scope of the TPSP’s PCI DSS assessment,
```
```
 The specific PCI DSS requirements and sub-requirements covered by the TPSP’s PCI DSS assessment,
```
```
 Any requirements that are the responsibility of the TPSP’s customers to include in their own PCI DSS assessments, and
```
```
 Any PCI DSS requirements for which the responsibility is shared between the TPSP and its customers.
```
```
For example, a cloud provider should clearly define which of its IP addresses are scanned as part of its quarterly vulnerability scan
process and which IP addresses are their customers’ responsibility to scan.
```
```
Per Requirement 12.9.2, TPSPs are required to support their customers’ requests for information about the TPSP’s PCI DSS
compliance status related to the services provided to customers, and about which PCI DSS requirements are the responsibility of the
TPSP, which are the responsibility of the customer, and any responsibilities between the customer and the TPSP. Refer to Tips and
Tools for Understanding PCI DSS v4.0 for a responsibility matrix template that may be used for documenting and clarifying how
responsibilities are shared between TPSPs and customers.
```
**_Options for TPSPs to Validate PCI DSS Compliance for TPSP Services that Meet Customers’ PCI DSS_**

**_Requirements_**

```
TPSPs are responsible for demonstrating their PCI DSS compliance as requested by organizations that manage compliance programs
(for example, payment brands and acquirers). TPSPs should contact the organizations of interest for any requirements.
```
```
When a TPSP provides services that are intended to meet or facilitate meeting a customer’s PCI DSS requirements or that may impact
the security of a customer’s CDE, these requirements are in scope for the customer’s PCI DSS assessments. There are two options for
TPSPs to validate compliance in this scenario:
```
```
 Annual assessment : TPSP undergoes an annual PCI DSS assessment(s) and provides evidence to its customers to show the
TPSP meets the applicable PCI DSS requirements; or
```
```
 Multiple, on-demand assessments : If a TPSP does not undergo an annual PCI DSS assessment, it must undergo assessments
upon request of their customers and/or participate in each of its customers’ PCI DSS assessments, with the results of each review
provided to the respective customer(s).
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
If the TPSP undergoes its own PCI DSS assessment, it is expected to provide sufficient evidence to its customers to verify that the
scope of the TPSP’s PCI DSS assessment covered the services applicable to the customer, and that the relevant PCI DSS
requirements were examined and determined to be in place. If the provider has an PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC), it is
expected that the TPSP provides the AOC to customers upon request. The customer may also request relevant sections of the TPSP’s
PCI DSS Report on Compliance (ROC). The ROC may be redacted to protect any confidential information.
```
```
If the TPSP does not undergo its own PCI DSS assessment and therefore does not have an AOC, the TPSP is expected to provide
specific evidence related to the applicable PCI DSS requirements, so that the customer (or its assessor) is able to confirm the TPSP is
meeting those PCI DSS requirements.
```
**_TPSPs Presence on a Payment Brand List(s) of PCI DSS Compliant Service Providers_**

```
For a customer that is monitoring a TPSP’s compliance status in accordance with Requirement 12.8, the TPSP’s presence on a
payment brand’s list of PCI DSS compliant service providers may be sufficient evidence of the TPSP’s compliance status if it is clear
from the list that the services applicable to the customer were covered by the TPSP’s PCI DSS assessment. If it is not clear from the list,
the customer should obtain other written confirmation that addresses the TPSP’s PCI DSS compliance status.
```
```
For a customer that is looking for evidence of PCI DSS compliance for requirements that a TPSP meets on a customer’s behalf or
where the service provided can impact the security of the customer’s CDE, the TPSP’s presence on a payment brand’s list of PCI DSS
compliant service providers is not sufficient evidence that the applicable PCI DSS requirements for that TPSP were included in the
assessment. If the TPSP has an PCI DSS AOC, it is expected to provide it to customers upon request.

## 5 Best Practices for Implementing PCI DSS into Business-as-Usual Processes

```
An entity that implements business-as-usual processes, otherwise known as BAU, as part of their overall security strategy is taking measures
to ensure that security controls that have been implemented to secure data and an environment continue to be implemented correctly and
functioning properly as normal course of business.
```
```
Some PCI DSS requirements are intended to act as BAU processes by monitoring security controls to ensure their effectiveness on an
ongoing basis. This oversight by the entity assists with providing reasonable assurance that the compliance of its environment is preserved
between PCI DSS assessments. While there are currently some BAU requirements defined within the standard, an entity should adopt
additional BAU processes specific to their organization and environment when possible. BAU processes are a way to verify that automated
and manual controls are performing as expected. Regardless of whether a PCI DSS requirement is automated or manual, it is important for
BAU processes to detect anomalies, and alert and report so that responsible individuals address the situation in a timely manner.
```
```
Examples of how PCI DSS should be incorporated into BAU activities include but are not limited to:
```
```
 Assigning overall responsibility and accountability for PCI DSS compliance to an individual or team. This can include a charter defined
by executive management for a specific PCI DSS compliance program and communication to executive management.
```
```
 Developing performance metrics to measure the effectiveness of security initiatives and continuous monitoring of security controls,
including those that are heavily relied upon, such as network security controls, intrusion-detection systems/intrusion-prevention systems
(IDS/IPS), change-detection mechanisms, anti-malware solutions, and access controls, to ensure they are operating effectively and as
intended.
```
```
 Reviewing logged data more frequently to gain insights to trends or behaviors that may not be obvious with only monitoring.
```
```
 Ensuring that all failures in security controls are detected and responded to promptly. Processes to respond to security control failures
should include:
```
- Restoring the security control.
- Identifying the cause of failure.
- Identifying and addressing any security issues that arose during the failure of the security control.
- Implementing mitigation, such as process or technical controls, to prevent the cause of the failure from recurring.
- Resuming monitoring of the security control, perhaps with enhanced monitoring for a period of time, to verify the control is operating
    effectively.

```
 Reviewing changes that could introduce security risks to the environment (for example, addition of new systems, changes in system or
network configurations) prior to completing the change, and including the following:
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

- Perform a risk assessment to determine the potential impact to PCI DSS scope (for example, a new network security control rule
    that permits connectivity between a system in the CDE and another system could bring additional systems or networks into scope
    for PCI DSS).
- Identify PCI DSS requirements applicable to systems and networks affected by the changes (for example, if a new system is in
    scope for PCI DSS, it would need to be configured per system configuration standards, including change-detection mechanisms,
    anti -malware software, patches, and audit logging. These new systems and networks would need to be added to the inventory of in-
    scope system components and to the quarterly vulnerability scan schedule).
- Update PCI DSS scope and implement security controls as appropriate.
- Update documentation to reflect implemented changes.

```
 Reviewing the impact to PCI DSS scope and requirements upon changes to organizational structure (for example, a company merger or
acquisition).
```
```
 Reviewing external connections and third-party access periodically.
```
```
 For entities that use third parties for software development, periodically confirming that those software development activities continue to
comply with software development requirements in Requirement 6.
```
```
 Performing periodic reviews to confirm that PCI DSS requirements continue to be in place and personnel follow established processes.
Periodic reviews should cover all facilities and locations, including retail outlets and data centers, whether self-managed or if a TPSP is
used. For example, periodic reviews can be used to confirm that configuration standards have been applied to applicable systems,
default vendor accounts and passwords are removed or disabled, patches and anti-malware solutions are up to date, audit logs are
being reviewed, and so on. The frequency of periodic reviews should be determined by the entity as appropriate for the size and
complexity of their environment, if not otherwise stated in PCI DSS.
```
```
These reviews can also be used to verify that required evidence for a PCI DSS assessment is being maintained. For example, evidence of
audit logs, vulnerability scan reports, and reviews of network security control rulesets are necessary to assist the entity in preparing for its next
PCI DSS assessment.
```
```
 Establishing communication with all impacted parties, both external and internal, about newly identified threats and changes to the
organization structure. Communication materials should help recipients understand the impact of threats, mitigating steps, and contact
points for further information or escalation.
```
```
 Reviewing hardware and software technologies at least once every 12 months to confirm that they continue to be supported by the
vendor and can meet the entity’s security requirements, including PCI DSS. If technologies are no longer supported by the vendor or
cannot meet the entity’s security needs, the entity should prepare a remediation plan, including replacement of the technology, as
necessary.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Note : Some best practices in this section are also included as PCI DSS requirements for certain entities. For example, those undergoing a full
PCI DSS assessment, service providers validating to the additional “service provider only” requirements, and designated entities that are
required to validate according to Appendix A3: Designated Entities Supplemental Validation.
```
```
Each entity should consider implementing these best practices into their environment, even if the entity is not required to validate to them (for
example, merchants undergoing self-assessment).
```
```

## 6 For Assessors: Sampling for PCI DSS Assessments......................................................................................................................................

```
Sampling is an option for assessors conducting PCI DSS assessments to facilitate the assessment process when there are large numbers of
items in a population being tested.
```
```
While it is acceptable for an assessor to sample from similar items in a population being tested as part of its review of an entity’s PCI DSS
compliance, it is not acceptable for an entity to apply PCI DSS requirements to only a sample of its environment (for example, requirements for
quarterly vulnerability scans apply to all system components). Similarly, it is not acceptable for an assessor to review only a sample of PCI
DSS requirements for compliance.
```
```
While sampling allows assessors to test less than 100% of a given sampling population, assessors should always strive for the most complete
review possible. Assessors are encouraged to use automated processes or other mechanisms if the complete population, regardless of size,
can be tested quickly and efficiently with minimal impact on the resources of the entity being assessed. Where automated processes are not
available to test 100% of a population, sampling is an equally acceptable approach.
```
```
After considering the overall scope, complexity, and consistency of the environment being assessed, and the nature (automated or manual) of
the processes used by an entity to meet a requirement, the assessor may independently select representative samples from the populations
being reviewed in order to assess the entity’s compliance with PCI DSS requirements. Samples must be a representative selection of all
variants of the population and must be sufficiently large to provide the assessor with assurance that controls are implemented as expected
across the entire population. Where testing the periodic performance of a requirement (for example, weekly or quarterly, or periodically), the
assessor should attempt to select a sample that represents the entire period covered by the assessment so that the assessor may make a
reasonable judgment that the requirement was met throughout the assessment period. Testing the same sample of items year after year could
allow unknown variations in the non-sampled items to remain undetected. Assessors must revalidate the sampling rationale for each
assessment and consider previous sample sets. Different samples must be selected for each assessment.
```
```
Appropriate selection of the sample depends on what is being considered in examining the sample members. For example, determining the
presence of anti-malware on servers known to be affected by malicious software may lead to determining the population to be all servers in
the environment, or all servers in the environment that are running a particular operating system, or all servers that are not mainframes, etc.
Selection of an appropriate sample would then include representatives of ALL members of the identified population, including all servers
running the identified operating system including all versions, as well as servers within the population that are used for different functions (web
server, application servers, database servers, etc.).
```
```
In the case that a specific configuration item is being considered, the population might be appropriately divided, and separate sample groups
identified. For example, a sample of all servers may not be appropriate when reviewing an operating system configuration setting, where
different operating systems are present within the environment. In this case, samples from each operating system type would be appropriate in
identifying that the configuration has been appropriately set for each operating system. Each sample set should include servers that are
representative of each operating system type, including version, as well as representative functions.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Other examples of sampling include selections of personnel with similar or varied roles, based on the requirement being assessed, for
example, a sample of administrators vs. a sample of all employees.
```
```
The assessor is required to use professional judgment in the planning, performance, and evaluation of the sample to support their conclusion
about whether and how the entity has met a requirement. The assessor’s goal in sampling is to obtain enough evidence to have a reasonable
basis for their opinion. When independently selecting samples, assessors should consider the following:
```
```
 The assessor must select the sample from the complete population without influence from the assessed entity.
```
```
 If the entity has standardized processes and controls in place that ensure consistency and which is applied to each item in the
population, the sample can be smaller than if the entity has no standardized processes/controls in place. The sample must be large
enough to provide the assessor with reasonable assurance that items in the population adhere to the standardized processes that are
applied to each item in the population. The assessor must verify that the standardized controls are implemented and working effectively.
```
```
 If the entity has more than one type of standardized process in place (for example, for different types of business facilities/system
components), the sample must include items subject to each type of process. For example, populations could be divided into sub-
populations based on characteristics that may impact the consistency of the assessed requirements, such as the use of different
processes or tools. Samples would then be selected from each sub-population.
```
```
 If the entity has no standardized PCI DSS processes/controls in place and each item in the population is managed through non-
standardized processes, the sample must be larger for the assessor to be assured that the PCI DSS requirements are appropriately
applied to each item in the population.
```
```
 Samples of system components must include every type and combination being used. When an entity has more than one CDE, samples
must include populations across all in-scope system components. For example, where applications are sampled, the sample must
include all versions and platforms for each type of application.
```
```
 Sample sizes must always be greater than one unless there is only one item in the given population, or an automated control is used
where the assessor has confirmed the control is functioning as programmed for each assessed sample population.
```
```
 If the assessor relies on standardized processes and controls being in place as a basis for selecting a sample, but then finds out during
testing that standardized processes and controls are not in place or not operating effectively, the assessor should then increase the
sample size to attempt to gain assurance that PCI DSS requirements are being met.
```
```
For each instance where sampling is used, the assessor must:
```
```
 Document the rationale behind the sampling technique and sample size.
```
```
 Validate and document the standardized processes and controls used to determine sample size.
```
```
 Explain how the sample is appropriate and representative of the overall population.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Figure 3 shows considerations for determining sample size.
```
**Figure 3. PCI DSS Sampling Considerations**

```
Note : In PCI DSS v4.0, specific references to sampling have been removed from all testing procedures. These references were removed
because calling out sampling only in some testing procedures may have implied that sampling was mandatory for those testing procedures
(which it was not) or that sampling was only allowable where it was specifically mentioned. Assessors should select samples when it is
appropriate to the population being tested, and, per above, render those decisions after considering the overall scope and complexity of an
environment.
```

## 7 Description of Timeframes Used in PCI DSS Requirements

```
Certain PCI DSS requirements have been established with specific timeframes for activities that need to be performed consistently via a
regularly scheduled and repeatable process. The intent is that the activity is performed at an interval as close to that timeframe as possible
without exceeding it. The entity has the discretion to perform an activity more often than specified (for example, performing an activity monthly
where the PCI DSS requirement specifies it be performed every three months).
```
```
Table 4 outlines the frequency for the different time periods used in PCI DSS Requirements.
```
**Table 4. PCI DSS Requirement Timeframes**

```
Timeframes in PCI DSS
Requirements
```
```
Descriptions and Examples
```
```
Daily Every day of the year (not only on business days).
```
```
Weekly At least once every seven days.
```
```
Monthly At least once every 30 to 31 days, or on the nth day of the month.
```
```
Every three months
(“quarterly”)
```
```
At least once every 90 to 92 days, or on the nth day of each third month.
```

```
```
At least once every 365 (or 366 for leap years) days or on the same date every year.
```
```
Periodically Frequency of occurrence is at the entity’s discretion and is documented and supported by the entity’s risk analysis. The entity
must demonstrate that the frequency is appropriate for the activity to be effective and to meet the intent of the requirement.
```
```

```
Timeframes in PCI DSS
Requirements
```
```
Descriptions and Examples
```
```
Significant change There are certain requirements for which performance is specified upon a significant change in an entity’s environment. While
what constitutes a significant change is highly dependent on the configuration of a given environment, each of the following
activities, at a minimum, has potential impacts on the security of the CDE and must be considered as a significant change in the
context of related PCI DSS requirements:
```
- New hardware, software, or networking equipment added to the CDE.
- Any replacement or major upgrades of hardware and software in the CDE.
- Any changes in the flow or storage of account data.
- Any changes to the boundary of the CDE and/or to the scope of the PCI DSS assessment.
- Any changes to the underlying supporting infrastructure of the CDE (including, but not limited to, changes to directory
    services, time servers, logging, and monitoring).
- Any changes to third party vendors/service providers (or services provided) that support the CDE or meet PCI DSS
    requirements on behalf of the entity.

```
For other PCI DSS requirements, where the standard does not define a minimum frequency for recurring activities but instead allows for the
requirement to be met “periodically,” the entity is expected to define the frequency as appropriate for its business. The frequency defined by
the entity must be supported by the entity’s security policy and the risk analysis conducted according to PCI DSS Requirement 12.3.1. The
entity must also be able to demonstrate that the frequency it has defined is appropriate for the activity to be effective and to meet the intent of
the requirement.
```
```
In both cases, where PCI DSS specifies a required frequency and where PCI DSS allows for “periodic” performance, the entity is expected to
have documented and implemented processes to ensure that activities are performed within a reasonable timeframe, including at least the
following:
```
```
 The entity is promptly notified any time an activity is not performed per its defined schedule,
```
```
 The entity determines the events that led to missing a scheduled activity,
```
```
 The entity performs the activity as soon as possible after it is missed and either gets back on schedule or establishes a new schedule,
```
```
 The entity produces documentation that shows the above elements occurred.
```
```
When an entity has the above processes in place to detect and address when a scheduled activity is missed, a reasonable approach is
allowable, meaning that if an activity is required to be performed at least once every three months, the entity is not automatically non-
compliant if the activity is performed late where the entity’s documented and implemented process (per above) was followed. However, where
no such process is in place and/or the activity was not performed according to schedule due to oversight, mismanagement, or lack of
monitoring, the entity has not met the requirement. In such cases, the requirement will only be in place when the entity 1) documents (or
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
reconfirms) the process per above to ensure the scheduled activity occurs on time, 2) re-establishes the schedule, and 3) provides evidence
that the entity has performed the scheduled activity at least once per their schedule.
```
```
Note : For an initial PCI DSS assessment (meaning an entity has never undergone a prior assessment), where a requirement has a defined
timeframe within which an activity is to occur, it is not required that the activity has been performed for every such timeframe during the
previous year, if the assessor verifies:
```
- _The activity was performed in accordance with the applicable requirement within the most recent timeframe (for example, the most recent_
    _three-month or six-month period), and_
- _The entity has documented policies and procedures for continuing to perform the activity within the defined timeframe._

```
For subsequent years after the initial assessment, the activity must have been performed at least once within each required timeframe. For
example, an activity required every three months must have been performed at least four times during the previous year at an interval that
does not exceed 90-92 days.
```

## 8 Approaches for Implementing and Validating PCI DSS

```
To support flexibility in how security objectives are met, there are two approaches for implementing and validating to PCI DSS. Entities should
identify the approach best suited to their security implementation and use that approach to validate the controls.
```
```
Defined Approach Follows the traditional method for implementing and validating PCI DSS and uses the Requirements and Testing
Procedures defined within the standard. In the defined approach, the entity implements security controls to meet
the stated requirements, and the assessor follows the defined testing procedures to verify that requirements
have been met.
```
```
The defined approach supports entities with controls in place that meet PCI DSS requirements as stated. This
approach may also suit entities that want more direction about how to meet security objectives, as well as
entities new to information security or PCI DSS.
```
```
Compensating Controls
```
```
As part of the defined approach, entities that cannot meet a PCI DSS
requirement explicitly as stated due to a legitimate and documented technical
or business constraint may implement other, or compensating, controls , that
sufficiently mitigate the risk associated with the requirement. On an annual
basis, any compensating controls must be documented by the entity and
reviewed and validated by the assessor and included with the Report on
Compliance submission.
```
```
Note: For more details, see
Appendix B: Compensating
Controls and Appendix C:
Compensating Controls
Worksheet.
```
```
Customized Approach Focuses on the Objective of each PCI DSS requirement (if applicable),
allowing entities to implement controls to meet the requirement’s stated
Customized Approach Objective in a way that does not strictly follow the
defined requirement. Because each customized implementation will be
different, there are no defined testing procedures; the assessor is required to
derive testing procedures that are appropriate to the specific implementation to
validate that the implemented controls meet the stated Objective.
```
```
The customized approach supports innovation in security practices, allowing entities greater flexibility to show
how their current security controls meet PCI DSS objectives. This approach is intended for risk-mature entities
that demonstrate a robust risk-management approach to security, including, but not limited to, a dedicated risk-
management department or an organization-wide risk management approach.
```
```
Note: For more details, see
Appendix D: Customized
Approach and Appendix E:
Sample Templates to
Support Customized
Approach.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
The controls implemented and validated using the customized approach are expected to meet or exceed the
security provided by the requirement in the defined approach. The level of documentation and effort required to
validate customized implementations will also be greater than for the defined approach
```
```
Most PCI DSS requirements can be met using either the defined or customized approach. However, several requirements do not have a
stated Customized Approach Objective; the customized approach is not an option for these requirements.
```
```
Entities can use both the defined and customized approaches within their environment. This means an entity could use the defined approach
to meet some requirements and use the customized approach to meet other requirements. This also means that an entity could use the
defined approach to meet a given PCI DSS requirement for one system component or within one environment and use the customized
approach to meet that same PCI DSS requirement for a different system component or within a different environment. In this way, a PCI DSS
assessment could include both defined and customized testing procedures.

## 9 Protecting Information About an Entity’s Security Posture

```
The processes related to becoming and maintaining a PCI DSS compliant environment results in many artifacts that an entity may consider
sensitive and may want to protect as such, including such items as the following:
```
```
 The Report on Compliance or Self-Assessment Questionnaire (the associated Attestation of Compliance is not considered sensitive and
third-party service providers (TPSPs) are expected to share their AOC with customers).
```
```
 Network diagrams and account data-flow diagrams, and security configurations and rules.
```
```
 System configuration standards.
```
```
 Cryptography and key management methods and protocols.
```
```
Entities should review all the artifacts related to PCI DSS controls or the assessment and protect them in accordance with the entity’s security
policies for this type of information.
```
```
TPSPs are required (PCI DSS Requirement 12.9) to support their customers with the following:
```
```
 Information needed for customers to monitor the TPSPs’ PCI DSS compliance status (to enable the customer to comply with
Requirement 12.8), and
```
```
 Evidence that the TPSP is meeting applicable PCI DSS requirements where the TPSP’s services are intended to meet or facilitate
meeting a customer’s PCI DSS requirements, or where those services may impact the security of a customer’s CDE.
```
```
This section does not impact or negate a TPSP’s obligation to support and provide information to their customers per Requirement 12.9.
```
```
For more details about expectations for TPSPs and relationships between TPSPs and customers, see Use of Third-Party Service Providers.
```
**_Protection of Confidential and Sensitive Information by Qualified Security Assessor Companies_**

```
Each Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) Company signs an agreement with PCI SSC that they will adhere to the Qualification Requirements
for QSAs. The Protection of Confidential and Sensitive Information section of that document includes the following:
```
```
“The QSA company must have and adhere to a documented process for protection of confidential and sensitive information. This must
include adequate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards consistent with industry-accepted practices to protect confidential and
sensitive information against any threats or unauthorized access during storage, processing, and/or communicating of this information.
```
```
The QSA Company must maintain the privacy and confidentiality of information obtained in the course of performing its duties and
obligations as a QSA Company, unless (and to the extent) disclosure is required by legal authority.”
```

## 10 Testing Methods for PCI DSS Requirements

```
The testing methods identified in the Testing Procedures for each requirement describe the expected activities to be performed by the
assessor to determine whether the entity has met the requirement. The intent behind each testing method is described as follows:
```
```
 Examine: The assessor critically evaluates data evidence. Common examples include documents (electronic or physical), screenshots,
configuration files, audit logs, and data files.
```
```
 Observe: The assessor watches an action or views something in the environment. Examples of observation subjects include personnel
performing a task or process, system components performing a function or responding to input, environmental conditions, and physical
controls.
```
```
 Interview: The assessor converses with individual personnel. Interview objectives may include confirmation of whether an activity is
performed, descriptions of how an activity is performed, and whether personnel have particular knowledge or understanding.
```
```
The testing methods are intended to allow the assessed entity to demonstrate how they have met a requirement. They also provide the
assessed entity and the assessor with a common understanding of the assessment activities to be performed. The specific items to be
examined or observed and personnel to be interviewed should be appropriate for both the requirement being assessed and each entity’s
particular implementation. When documenting the assessment results, the assessor identifies the testing activities performed and the result of
each activity.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

## 11 Instructions and Content for Report on Compliance

Instructions and content for the Report on Compliance (ROC) are provided in the _PCI DSS Report on Compliance (ROC) Template_.

The PCI DSS Report on Compliance (ROC) Template must be used as the template for creating a PCI DSS Report on Compliance.

Whether any entity is required to comply with or validate their compliance to PCI DSS is at the discretion of those organizations that manage

compliance programs (such as payment brands and acquirers). Entities should contact the organizations of interest to determine any reporting

requirements and instructions.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

## 12 PCI DSS Assessment Process

```
The PCI DSS assessment process includes the following high-level steps:^5
```
1. Confirm the scope of the PCI DSS assessment.
2. Perform the PCI DSS assessment of the environment.
3. Complete the applicable report for the assessment according to PCI DSS guidance and instructions.
4. Complete the Attestation of Compliance for Service Providers or Merchants, as applicable, in its entirety. Official Attestations of
    Compliance are only available on the PCI SSC website.
5. Submit the applicable PCI SSC documentation and the Attestation of Compliance, along with any other requested documentation—such
    as ASV scan reports—to the requesting organization (those that manage compliance programs such as payment brands and acquirers
    (for merchants), or other requesters (for service providers)).
6. If required, perform remediation to address requirements that are not in place and provide an updated report.

```
Note: PCI DSS requirements are not considered to be in place if controls are not yet implemented or are scheduled to be completed at a
future date. After any open or not-in-place items are addressed by the entity, the assessor will reassess to validate that the remediation is
completed and that all requirements are satisfied. Refer to the following resources (available on the PCI SSC website) to document the PCI
DSS assessment:
```
- _For instructions about completing reports on compliance (ROC), refer to the PCI DSS Report on Compliance (ROC) Template._
- _For instructions about completing self-assessment questionnaires (SAQ), refer to the PCI DSS SAQ Instructions and Guidelines._
- _For instructions about submitting PCI DSS compliance validation reports, refer to the PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance._

(^5) The PCI DSS assessment process, and the roles and responsibilities for completion of each step, vary depending on the type of assessment and on compliance
programs, which are managed by payment brands and acquirers.

**_Additional Requirements for Service Providers Only_**

```
Some requirements apply only when the entity being assessed is a service provider. These are identified within the requirement as “ Additional
requirement for service providers only” and apply in addition to all other applicable requirements. Where the entity being assessed is both a
merchant and a service provider, requirements noted as “ Additional requirement for service providers only” apply to the service provider
portion of the entity’s business. Requirements identified with “ Additional requirement for service providers only” are also recommended as best
practices for consideration by all entities.
```
**_Appendices with Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Different Types of Entities_**

### Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems

**_Requirement 1: Install and Maintain Network Security Controls_**

```
Sections
```
```
1.1 Processes and mechanisms for installing and maintaining network security controls are defined and understood.
1.2 Network security controls (NSCs) are configured and maintained.
1.3 Network access to and from the cardholder data environment is restricted.
1.4 Network connections between trusted and untrusted networks are controlled.
1.5 Risks to the CDE from computing devices that are able to connect to both untrusted networks and the CDE are mitigated.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Overview
```
```
Network security controls (NSCs), such as firewalls and other network security technologies, are network policy enforcement points that
typically control network traffic between two or more logical or physical network segments (or subnets) based on pre-defined policies or rules.
```
```
NSCs examine all network traffic entering (ingress) and leaving (egress) a segment and decide, based on the policies defined, whether the
network traffic is allowed to pass or whether it should be rejected. Typically, NSCs are placed between environments with different security
needs or levels of trust, however in some environments NSCs control the traffic to individual devices irrespective of trust boundaries. Policy
enforcement generally occurs at layer 3 of the OSI model, but data present in higher layers is also frequently used to determine policy
decisions.
```
```
Traditionally this function has been provided by physical firewalls; however, now this functionality may be provided by virtual devices, cloud
access controls, virtualization/container systems, and other software-defined networking technology.
```
```
NSCs are used to control traffic within an entity’s own networks—for example, between highly sensitive and less sensitive areas—and also to
protect the entity’s resources from exposure to untrusted networks. The cardholder data environment (CDE) is an example of a more sensitive
area within an entity’s network. Often, seemingly insignificant paths to and from untrusted networks can provide unprotected pathways into
sensitive systems. NSCs provide a key protection mechanism for any computer network.
```
```
Common examples of untrusted networks include the Internet, dedicated connections such as business-to-business communication channels,
wireless networks, carrier networks (such as cellular), third-party networks, and other sources outside the entity’s ability to control. Furthermore,
untrusted networks also include corporate networks that are considered out-of-scope for PCI DSS, because they are not assessed, and
therefore must be treated as untrusted because the existence of security controls has not been verified. While an entity may consider an
internal network to be trusted from an infrastructure perspective, if a network is out of scope for PCI DSS, that network must be considered
untrusted for PCI DSS.
```
```
Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
1.1 Processes and mechanisms for installing and maintaining network security controls are defined and understood.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 1.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 1.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 1, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For these
reasons, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives.
```
```
1.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 1 are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```
1.1.1 Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that security policies and
operational procedures identified in Requirement 1
are managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting
activities within Requirement 1 are defined,
understood, and adhered to by affected personnel.
All supporting activities are repeatable, consistently
applied, and conform to management’s intent.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
1.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing
activities in Requirement 1 are documented,
assigned, and understood.
```
```
1.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that
descriptions of roles and responsibilities for
performing activities in Requirement 1 are
documented and assigned.
```
```
1.1.2.b Interview personnel responsible for
performing activities in Requirement 1 to verify that
roles and responsibilities are assigned as
documented and are understood.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the
activities in Requirement 1 are allocated. Personnel
are accountable for successful, continuous
operation of these requirements.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
1.2 Network security controls (NSCs) are configured and maintained.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The implementation of these configuration
standards results in the NSC being configured
and managed to properly perform their security
function (often referred to as the ruleset).
Good Practice
These standards often define the requirements for
acceptable protocols, ports that are permitted to
be used, and specific configuration requirements
that are acceptable. Configuration standards may
also outline what the entity considers not
acceptable or not permitted within its network.
Definitions
NSCs are key components of a network
architecture. Most commonly, NSCs are used at
the boundaries of the CDE to control network
traffic flowing inbound and outbound from the
CDE.
Configuration standards outline an entity’s
minimum requirements for the configuration of its
NSCs
Examples
Examples of NSCs covered by these
configuration standards include, but are not
limited to, firewalls, routers configured with
access control lists, and cloud virtual networks.
```
```
1.2.1 Configuration standards for NSC rulesets are:
```
- Defined.
- Implemented.
- Maintained.

```
1.2.1.a Examine the configuration standards for
NSC rulesets to verify the standards are in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
1.2.1.b Examine configuration settings for NSC
rulesets to verify that rulesets are implemented
according to the configuration standards.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The way that NSCs are configured and operate are
defined and consistently applied.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Good Practice^
Changes should be approved by individuals with
the appropriate authority and knowledge to
understand the impact of the change. Verification
should provide reasonable assurance that the
change did not adversely impact the security of
the network and that the change performs as
expected.
To avoid having to address security issues
introduced by a change, all changes should be
approved prior to being implemented and verified
after the change is implemented. Once approved
and verified, network documentation should be
updated to include the changes to prevent
inconsistencies between network documentation
and the actual configuration.
```
```
1.2.2 All changes to network connections and to
configurations of NSCs are approved and managed
in accordance with the change control process
defined at Requirement 6.5.1.
```
```
1.2.2.a Examine documented procedures to verify
that changes to network connections and
configurations of NSCs are included in the formal
change control process in accordance with
Requirement 6.5.1.
```
```
1.2.2.b Examine network configuration settings to
identify changes made to network connections.
Interview responsible personnel and examine
change control records to verify that identified
changes to network connections were approved
and managed in accordance with Requirement
6.5.1.
```
```
1.2.2.c Examine network configuration settings to
identify changes made to configurations of NSCs.
Interview responsible personnel and examine
change control records to verify that identified
changes to configurations of NSCs were approved
and managed in accordance with Requirement
6.5.1.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Changes to network connections and NSCs cannot
result in misconfiguration, implementation of
insecure services, or unauthorized network
connections.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
Changes to network connections include the
addition, removal, or modification of a connection.
Changes to NSC configurations include those
related to the component itself as well as those
affecting how it performs its security function.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Maintaining an accurate and up-to-date network
diagram(s) prevents network connections and
devices from being overlooked and unknowingly
left unsecured and vulnerable to compromise.
A properly maintained network diagram(s) helps
an organization verify its PCI DSS scope by
identifying systems connecting to and from the
CDE.
Good Practice
All connections to and from the CDE should be
identified, including systems providing security,
management, or maintenance services to CDE
system components. Entities should consider
including the following in their network diagrams:
```
- All locations, including retail locations, data
    centers, corporate locations, cloud providers,
    etc.
- Clear labeling of all network segments.
- All security controls providing segmentation,
    including unique identifiers for each control
    (for example, name of control, make, model,
    and version).
- All in-scope system components, including
    NSCs, web app firewalls, anti-malware
    solutions, change management solutions,
    IDS/IPS, log aggregation systems, payment
    terminals, payment applications, HSMs, etc.
- Clear labeling of any out-of-scope areas on
    the diagram via a shaded box or other
    mechanism.
- Date of last update, and names of people that
    made and approved the updates.
- A legend or key to explain the diagram.
Diagrams should be updated by authorized
personnel to ensure diagrams continue to provide
an accurate description of the network.

```
1.2.3 An accurate network diagram(s) is maintained
that shows all connections between the CDE and
other networks, including any wireless networks.
```
```
1.2.3.a Examine diagram(s) and network
configurations to verify that an accurate network
diagram(s) exists in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
1.2.3.b Examine documentation and interview
responsible personnel to verify that the network
diagram(s) is accurate and updated when there are
changes to the environment.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
A representation of the boundaries between the
CDE, all trusted networks, and all untrusted
networks, is maintained and available.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
A current network diagram(s) or other technical or
topological solution that identifies network
connections and devices can be used to meet this
requirement.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
An up-to-date, readily available data-flow diagram
helps an organization understand and keep track
of the scope of its environment by showing how
account data flows across networks and between
individual systems and devices.
Maintaining an up-to-date data-flow diagram(s)
prevents account data from being overlooked and
unknowingly left unsecured.
Good Practice
The data-flow diagram should include all
connection points where account data is received
into and sent out of the network, including
connections to open, public networks, application
processing flows, storage, transmissions between
systems and networks, and file backups.
The data-flow diagram is meant to be in addition
to the network diagram and should reconcile with
and augment the network diagram. As a best
practice, entities can consider including the
following in their data-flow diagrams:
```
- All processing flows of account data, including
    authorization, capture, settlement,
    chargeback, and refunds.
- All distinct acceptance channels, including
    card-present, card-not-present, and e-
    commerce.
- All types of data receipt or transmission,
    including any involving hard copy/paper
    media.
- The flow of account data from the point where

entities with which account data is shared.

- Date of last update, and names of people that
    made and approved the updates.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Compromises often happen due to unused or
insecure services (for example, telnet and FTP),
protocols, and ports, since these can lead to
unnecessary points of access being opened into
the CDE. Additionally, services, protocols, and
ports that are enabled but not in use are often
overlooked and left unsecured and unpatched. By
identifying the services, protocols, and ports
necessary for business, entities can ensure that
all other services, protocols, and ports are
disabled or removed.
Good Practice
The security risk associated with each service,
protocol, and port allowed should be understood.
Approvals should be granted by personnel
independent of those managing the configuration.
Approving personnel should possess knowledge
and accountability appropriate for making
approval decisions.
```
```
1.2.5 All services, protocols, and ports allowed are
identified, approved, and have a defined business
need.
```
```
1.2.5.a Examine documentation to verify that a list
exists of all allowed services, protocols, and ports,
including business justification and approval for
each.
```
```
1.2.5.b Examine configuration settings for NSCs to
verify that only approved services, protocols, and
Customized Approach Objective ports are in use.^
```
```
Unauthorized network traffic (services, protocols, or
packets destined for specific ports) cannot enter or
leave the network.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Compromises take advantage of insecure
network configurations.
Good Practice
If insecure services, protocols, or ports are
necessary for business, the risk posed by these
services, protocols, and ports should be clearly
understood and accepted by the organization, the
use of the service, protocol, or port should be
justified, and the security features that mitigate
the risk of using these services, protocols, and
ports should be defined and implemented by the
entity.
Further Information
For guidance on services, protocols, or ports
considered to be insecure, refer to industry
standards and guidance (for example, from NIST,
ENISA, OWASP).
```
```
1.2.6 Security features are defined and
implemented for all services, protocols, and ports
that are in use and considered to be insecure, such
that the risk is mitigated.
```
```
1.2.6.a Examine documentation that identifies all
insecure services, protocols, and ports in use to
verify that for each, security features are defined to
mitigate the risk.
```
```
1.2.6.b Examine configuration settings for NSCs to
verify that the defined security features are
implemented for each identified insecure service,
protocol, and port.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The specific risks associated with the use of
insecure services, protocols, and ports are
understood, assessed, and appropriately mitigated.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Such a review gives the organization an
opportunity to clean up any unneeded, outdated,
or incorrect rules and configurations which could
be utilized by an unauthorized person.
Furthermore, it ensures that all rules and
configurations allow only authorized services,
protocols, and ports that match the documented
business justifications.
Good Practice
This review, which can be implemented using
manual, automated, or system-based methods, is
intended to confirm that the settings that manage
traffic rules, what is allowed in and out of the
network, match the approved configurations.
The review should provide confirmation that all
permitted access has a justified business reason.
Any discrepancies or uncertainties about a rule or
configuration should be escalated for resolution.
While this requirement specifies that this review
occur at least once every six months,
organizations with a high volume of changes to
their network configurations may wish to consider
performing reviews more frequently to ensure that
the configurations continue to meet the needs of
the business.
```
```
1.2.7 Configurations of NSCs are reviewed at least
once every six months to confirm they are relevant
and effective.
```
```
1.2.7.a Examine documentation to verify
procedures are defined for reviewing
configurations of NSCs at least once every six
months.
```
```
1.2.7.b Examine documentation of reviews of
configurations for NSCs and interview responsible
personnel to verify that reviews occur at least once
every six months.
```
```
1.2.7.c Examine configurations for NSCs to verify
that configurations identified as no longer being
supported by a business justification are removed
or updated.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
NSC configurations that allow or restrict access to
trusted networks are verified periodically to ensure
that only authorized connections with a current
business justification are permitted.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
To prevent unauthorized configurations from
being applied to the network, stored files with
configurations for network controls need to be
kept up to date and secured against unauthorized
changes.
Keeping configuration information current and
secure ensures that the correct settings for NSCs
are applied whenever the configuration is run.
Examples
If the secure configuration for a router is stored in
non-volatile memory, when that router is restarted
or rebooted, these controls should ensure that its
secure configuration is reinstated.
```
```
1.2.8 Configuration files for NSCs are:
```
- Secured from unauthorized access.
- Kept consistent with active network
    configurations.

```
1.2.8 Examine configuration files for NSCs to verify
they are in accordance with all elements specified
in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
NSCs cannot be defined or modified using untrusted
configuration objects (including files).
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
Any file or setting used to configure or synchronize
NSCs is considered to be a “configuration file.” This
includes files, automated and system-based
controls, scripts, settings, infrastructure as code, or
other parameters that are backed up, archived, or
stored remotely.

1.3 Network access to and from the cardholder data environment is restricted.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
This requirement aims to prevent malicious
individuals from accessing the entity’s network via
unauthorized IP addresses or from using
services, protocols, or ports in an unauthorized
manner.
Good Practice
All traffic inbound to the CDE, regardless of where
it originates, should be evaluated to ensure it
follows established, authorized rules. Connections
should be inspected to ensure traffic is restricted
to only authorized communications—for example,
by restricting source/destination addresses and
ports, and blocking of content.
Examples
Implementing a rule that denies all inbound and
outbound traffic that is not specifically needed—
for example, by using an explicit “deny all” or
implicit deny after allow statement—helps to
prevent inadvertent holes that would allow
unintended and potentially harmful traffic.
```
```
1.3.1 Inbound traffic to the CDE is restricted as
follows:
```
- To only traffic that is necessary.
- All other traffic is specifically denied.

```
1.3.1.a Examine configuration standards for NSCs
to verify that they define restricting inbound traffic
to the CDE is in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.

1.3.1.b Examine configurations of NSCs to verify
that inbound traffic to the CDE is restricted in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.

with an untrusted external host.
Good Practice
All traffic outbound from the CDE, regardless of
the destination, should be evaluated to ensure it
follows established, authorized rules. Connections
should be inspected to restrict traffic to only
authorized communications—for example, by
restricting source/destination addresses and

1.3.2.b Examine configurations of NSCs to verify
that outbound traffic from the CDE is restricted in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Unauthorized traffic cannot leave the CDE.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The known (or unknown) implementation and
exploitation of wireless technology within a
network is a common path for malicious
individuals to gain access to the network and
account data. If a wireless device or network is
installed without the entity’s knowledge, a
malicious individual could easily and “invisibly”
enter the network. If NSCs do not restrict access
from wireless networks into the CDE, malicious
individuals that gain unauthorized access to the
wireless network can easily connect to the CDE
and compromise account information.
```
```
1.3.3 NSCs are installed between all wireless
networks and the CDE, regardless of whether the
wireless network is a CDE, such that:
```
- All wireless traffic from wireless networks into the
    CDE is denied by default.
- Only wireless traffic with an authorized business
    purpose is allowed into the CDE.

```
1.3.3 Examine configuration settings and network
diagrams to verify that NSCs are implemented
between all wireless networks and the CDE, in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Unauthorized traffic cannot traverse network
boundaries between any wireless networks and
wired environments in the CDE.
```

1.4 Network connections between trusted and untrusted networks are controlled.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Implementing NSCs at every connection coming
into and out of trusted networks allows the entity
to monitor and control access and minimizes the
chances of a malicious individual obtaining
access to the internal network via an unprotected
connection.
Examples
An entity could implement a DMZ, which is a part
of the network that manages connections
between an untrusted network (for examples of
untrusted networks refer to the Requirement 1
Overview) and services that an organization
needs to have available to the public, such as a
web server. Please note that if an entity’s DMZ
processes or transmits account data (for example,
e-commerce website), it is also considered a
CDE.
```
```
1.4.1 NSCs are implemented between trusted and
untrusted networks.
```
```
1.4.1.a Examine configuration standards and
network diagrams to verify that NSCs are defined
between trusted and untrusted networks.
```
```
1.4.1.b Examine network configurations to verify
that NSCs are in place between trusted and
untrusted networks, in accordance with the
documented configuration standards and network
diagrams.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Unauthorized traffic cannot traverse network
boundaries between trusted and untrusted
networks.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Ensuring that public access to a system
component is specifically authorized reduces the
risk of system components being unnecessarily
exposed to untrusted networks.
Good Practice
System components that provide publicly
accessible services, such as email, web, and
DNS servers, are the most vulnerable to threats
originating from untrusted networks.
Ideally, such systems are placed within a
dedicated trusted network that is public facing (for
example, a DMZ) but that is separated via NSCs
from more sensitive internal systems, which helps
protect the rest of the network in the event these
externally accessible systems are compromised.
This functionality is intended to prevent malicious
actors from accessing the organization's internal
network from the Internet, or from using services,
protocols, or ports in an unauthorized manner.
Where this functionality is provided as a built-in
feature of an NSC, the entity should ensure that
its configurations do not result in the functionality
being disabled or bypassed.
Definitions
Maintaining the "state" (or status) for each
connection into a network means the NSC
“knows” whether an apparent response to a
previous connection is a valid, authorized
response (since the NSC retains each
connection’s status) or whether it is malicious
traffic trying to fool the NSC into allowing the
connection.
```
```
1.4.2 Inbound traffic from untrusted networks to
trusted networks is restricted to:
```
- Communications with system components that
    are authorized to provide publicly accessible
    services, protocols, and ports.
- Stateful responses to communications initiated
    by system components in a trusted network.
- All other traffic is denied.

```
1.4.2 Examine vendor documentation and
configurations of NSCs to verify that inbound traffic
from untrusted networks to trusted networks is
restricted in accordance with all elements specified
in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Only traffic that is authorized or that is a response to
a system component in the trusted network can
enter a trusted network from an untrusted network.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
The intent of this requirement is to address
communication sessions between trusted and
untrusted networks, rather than the specifics of
protocols.
This requirement does not limit the use of UDP or
other connectionless network protocols if state is
maintained by the NSC.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Filtering packets coming into the trusted network
helps to, among other things, ensure packets are
not “spoofed” to appear as if they are coming from
an organization’s own internal network. For
example, anti-spoofing measures prevent internal
addresses originating from the Internet from
passing into the DMZ.
Good Practice
Products usually come with anti-spoofing set as a
default and may not be configurable. Entities
should consult the vendor's documentation for
more information.
Examples
Normally, a packet contains the IP address of the
computer that originally sent it so other computers
in the network know where the packet originated.
Malicious individuals will often try to spoof (or
imitate) the sending IP address to fool the target
system into believing the packet is from a trusted
source.
```
```
1.4.3 Anti-spoofing measures are implemented to
detect and block forged source IP addresses from
entering the trusted network.
```
```
1.4.3 Examine vendor documentation and
configurations for NSCs to verify that anti-spoofing
measures are implemented to detect and block
forged source IP addresses from entering the
Customized Approach Objective trusted network.^
```
```
Packets with forged IP source addresses cannot
enter a trusted network.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Cardholder data that is directly accessible from an
untrusted network, for example, because it is
stored on a system within the DMZ or in a cloud
database service, is easier for an external
attacker to access because there are fewer
defensive layers to penetrate. Using NSCs to
ensure that system components that store
cardholder data (such as a database or a file) can
only be directly accessed from trusted networks
can prevent unauthorized network traffic from
reaching the system component.
```
```
1.4.4 System components that store cardholder
data are not directly accessible from untrusted
networks.
```
```
1.4.4.a Examine the data-flow diagram and
network diagram to verify that it is documented that
system components storing cardholder data are
not directly accessible from the untrusted
networks.
```
```
1.4.4.b Examine configurations of NSCs to verify
that controls are implemented such that system
components storing cardholder data are not
directly accessible from untrusted networks.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Stored cardholder data cannot be accessed from
untrusted networks.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is not intended to apply to storage
of account data in volatile memory but does apply
where memory is being treated as persistent
storage (for example, RAM disk). Account data can
only be stored in volatile memory during the time
necessary to support the associated business
process (for example, until completion of the related
payment card transaction).

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Restricting the disclosure of internal, private, and
local IP addresses is useful to prevent a hacker
from obtaining knowledge of these IP addresses
and using that information to access the network.
Good Practice
Methods used to meet the intent of this
requirement may vary, depending on the specific
networking technology being used. For example,
the controls used to meet this requirement may
be different for IPv4 networks than for IPv6
networks.
Examples
Methods to obscure IP addressing may include,
but are not limited to:
```
- IPv4 Network Address Translation (NAT).
- Placing system components behind proxy
    servers/NSCs.
- Removal or filtering of route advertisements
    for internal networks that use registered
    addressing.
- Internal use of RFC 1918 (IPv4) or use IPv6
    privacy extension (RFC 4941) when initiating
    outgoing sessions to the internet.

```
1.4.5 The disclosure of internal IP addresses and
routing information is limited to only authorized
parties.

1.4.5.b Interview personnel and examine
documentation to verify that controls are
implemented such that any disclosure of internal IP
addresses and routing information is limited to only

1.5 Risks to the CDE from computing devices that are able to connect to both untrusted networks and the CDE are mitigated.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Computing devices that are allowed to connect to
the Internet from outside the corporate
environment—for example, desktops, laptops,
tablets, smartphones, and other mobile computing
devices used by employees—are more vulnerable
to Internet-based threats.
Use of security controls such as host-based
controls (for example, personal firewall software
or end-point protection solutions), network-based
security controls (for example, firewalls, network-
based heuristics inspection, and malware
simulation), or hardware, helps to protect devices
from Internet-based attacks, which could use the
device to gain access to the organization’s
systems and data when the device reconnects to
the network.
```
```
(continued on next page)
```
```
1.5.1 Security controls are implemented on any
computing devices, including company- and
employee-owned devices, that connect to both
untrusted networks (including the Internet) and the
CDE as follows:
```
- Specific configuration settings are defined to
    prevent threats being introduced into the
    entity’s network.
- Security controls are actively running.
- Security controls are not alterable by users of
    the computing devices unless specifically
    documented and authorized by management on
    a case-by-case basis for a limited period.

```
1.5.1.a Examine policies and configuration
standards and interview personnel to verify
security controls for computing devices that
connect to both untrusted networks, and the CDE,
are implemented in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
1.5.1.b Examine configuration settings on
computing devices that connect to both untrusted
networks and the CDE to verify settings are
implemented in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Devices that connect to untrusted environments and
also connect to the CDE cannot introduce threats to
the entity’s CDE.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Applicability Notes Good Practice^
The specific configuration settings are determined
by the entity and should be consistent with its
network security policies and procedures.
Where there is a legitimate need to temporarily
disable security controls on a company-owned or
employee-owned device that connects to both an
untrusted network and the CDE—for example, to
support a specific maintenance activity or
investigation of a technical problem—the reason
for taking such action is understood and approved
by an appropriate management representative.
Any disabling or altering of these security
controls, including on administrators’ own
devices, is performed by authorized personnel.
It is recognized that administrators have privileges
that may allow them to disable security controls
on their own computers, but there should be
alerting mechanisms in place when such controls
are disabled and follow up that occurs to ensure
processes were followed.
Examples
Practices include forbidding split-tunneling of
VPNs for employee-owned or corporate-owned
mobile devices and requiring that such devices
boot up into a VPN.
```
```
These security controls may be temporarily disabled
only if there is legitimate technical need, as
authorized by management on a case-by-case
basis. If these security controls need to be disabled
for a specific purpose, it must be formally
authorized. Additional security measures may also
need to be implemented for the period during which
these security controls are not active.
This requirement applies to employee-owned and
company-owned computing devices. Systems that
cannot be managed by corporate policy introduce
weaknesses and provide opportunities that
malicious individuals may exploit.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 2.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 2.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 2, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security

If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and

Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).

2.2 System components are configured and managed securely.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
There are known weaknesses with many
operating systems, databases, network devices,
software, applications, container images, and
other devices used by an entity or within an
entity’s environment. There are also known ways
to configure these system components to fix
security vulnerabilities. Fixing security
vulnerabilities reduces the opportunities available
to an attacker.
By developing standards, entities ensure their
system components will be configured
consistently and securely, and address the
protection of devices for which full hardening may
be more difficult.
Good Practice
Keeping up to date with current industry guidance
will help the entity maintain secure configurations.
The specific controls to be applied to a system will
vary and should be appropriate for the type and
function of the system.
Numerous security organizations have
established system-hardening guidelines and
recommendations, which advise how to correct
common, known weaknesses.
Further Information
Sources for guidance on configuration standards
include but are not limited to: Center for Internet
Security (CIS), International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), Cloud
Security Alliance, and product vendors.
```
```
2.2.1 Configuration standards are developed,
implemented, and maintained to:
```
- Cover all system components.
- Address all known security vulnerabilities.
- Be consistent with industry-accepted system
    hardening standards or vendor hardening
    recommendations.
- Be updated as new vulnerability issues are
    identified, as defined in Requirement 6.3.1.
- Be applied when new systems are configured
    and verified as in place before or immediately
    after a system component is connected to a
    production environment.

```
2.2.1.a Examine system configuration standards
to verify they define processes that include all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
2.2.1.b Examine policies and procedures and
interview personnel to verify that system
configuration standards are updated as new
vulnerability issues are identified, as defined in
Requirement 6.3.1.
```
```
2.2.1.c Examine configuration settings and
interview personnel to verify that system
configuration standards are applied when new
systems are configured and verified as being in
place before or immediately after a system
component is connected to a production
environment.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
All system components are configured securely and
consistently and in accordance with industry-
accepted hardening standards or vendor
recommendations.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Malicious individuals often use vendor default
account names and passwords to compromise
operating systems, applications, and the systems
on which they are installed. Because these
default settings are often published and are well
known, changing these settings will make
systems less vulnerable to attack.
Good Practice
All vendor default accounts should be identified,
and their purpose and use understood. It is
important to establish controls for application and
system accounts, including those used to deploy
and maintain cloud services so that they do not
use default passwords and are not usable by
unauthorized individuals.
Where a default account is not intended to be
used, changing the default password to a unique
password that meets PCI DSS Requirement
8.3.6, removing any access to the default
account, and then disabling the account, will
prevent a malicious individual from re-enabling
the account and gaining access with the default
password.
Using an isolated staging network to install and
configure new systems is recommended and can
also be used to confirm that default credentials
have not been introduced into production
environments.
Examples
Defaults to be considered include user IDs,
passwords, and other authentication credentials
commonly used by vendors in their products.
```
```
2.2.2 Vendor default accounts are managed as
follows:
```
- If the vendor default account(s) will be used, the
    default password is changed per Requirement
    8.3.6.
- If the vendor default account(s) will not be used,
    the account is removed or disabled.

```
2.2.2.a Examine system configuration standards to
verify they include managing vendor default
accounts in accordance with all elements specified
in this requirement.
```
```
2.2.2.b Examine vendor documentation and
observe a system administrator logging on using
vendor default accounts to verify accounts are
implemented in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
2.2.2.c Examine configuration files and interview
personnel to verify that all vendor default accounts
Customized Approach Objective that will not be used are removed or disabled.^
```
```
System components cannot be accessed using
default passwords.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This applies to ALL vendor default accounts and
passwords, including, but not limited to, those used
by operating systems, software that provides
security services, application and system accounts,
point-of-sale (POS) terminals, payment applications,
and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
defaults.
This requirement also applies where a system
component is not installed within an entity’s
environment, for example, software and applications
that are part of the CDE and are accessed via a
cloud subscription service.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Systems containing a combination of services,
protocols, and daemons for their primary function
will have a security profile appropriate to allow
that function to operate effectively. For example,
systems that need to be directly connected to the
Internet would have a particular profile, like a
DNS server, web server, or an e-commerce
server. Conversely, other system components
may operate a primary function comprising a
different set of services, protocols, and daemons
that performs functions that an entity does not
want exposed to the Internet. This requirement
aims to ensure that different functions do not
impact the security profiles of other services in a
way which may cause them to operate at a higher
or lower security level.
Good Practice
Ideally, each function should be placed on
different system components. This can be
achieved by implementing only one primary
function on each system component. Another
option is to isolate primary functions on the same
system component that have different security
levels, for example, isolating web servers (which
need to be directly connected to the Internet) from
application and database servers.
(continued on next page)
```
```
2.2.3 Primary functions requiring different security
levels are managed as follows:
```
- Only one primary function exists on a system
    component,
**OR**
- Primary functions with differing security levels
    that exist on the same system component are
    isolated from each other,
**OR**
- Primary functions with differing security levels on
    the same system component are all secured to
    the level required by the function with the highest
    security need.

```
2.2.3.a Examine system configuration standards to
verify they include managing primary functions
requiring different security levels as specified in
this requirement.
```
```
2.2.3.b Examine system configurations to verify
that primary functions requiring different security
levels are managed per one of the ways specified
in this requirement.
```
```
2.2.3.c Where virtualization technologies are used,
examine the system configurations to verify that
system functions requiring different security levels
are managed in one of the following ways:
```
- Functions with differing security needs do not
    co-exist on the same system component.
- Functions with differing security needs that exist
    on the same system component are isolated
    from each other.
- Functions with differing security needs on the
    same system component are all secured to the
    level required by the function with the highest
    security need.

```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Primary functions with lower security needs cannot
affect the security of primary functions with higher
security needs on the same system component.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
If a system component contains primary functions
that need different security levels, a third option is
to implement additional controls to ensure that the
resultant security level of the primary function(s)
with higher security needs is not reduced by the
presence of the lower security primary functions.
Additionally, the functions with a lower security
level should be isolated and/or secured to ensure
they cannot access or affect the resources of
another system function, and do not introduce
security weaknesses to other functions on the
same server.
Functions of differing security levels may be
isolated by either physical or logical controls. For
example, a database system should not also be
hosting web services unless using controls like
virtualization technologies to isolate and contain
the functions into separate sub-systems. Another
example is using virtual instances or providing
dedicated memory access by system function.
Where virtualization technologies are used, the
security levels should be identified and managed
for each virtual component. Examples of
considerations for virtualized environments
include:
```
- The function of each application, container, or
    virtual server instance.
- How virtual machines (VMs) or containers are
    stored and secured.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Unnecessary services and functions can provide
additional opportunities for malicious individuals
to gain access to a system. By removing or
disabling all unnecessary services, protocols,
daemons, and functions, organizations can focus
on securing the functions that are required and
reduce the risk that unknown or unnecessary
functions will be exploited.
Good Practice
There are many protocols that could be enabled
by default that are commonly used by malicious
individuals to compromise a network. Disabling or
removing all services, functions, and protocols
that are not used minimizes the potential attack
surface—for example, by removing or disabling
an unused FTP or web server.
Examples
Unnecessary functionality may include, but is not
limited to scripts, drivers, features, subsystems,
file systems, interfaces (USB and Bluetooth), and
unnecessary web servers.
```
```
2.2.4 Only necessary services, protocols, daemons,
and functions are enabled, and all unnecessary
functionality is removed or disabled.
```
```
2.2.4.a Examine system configuration standards to
verify necessary system services, protocols, and
daemons are identified and documented.
```
```
2.2.4.b Examine system configurations to verify the
following:
```
- All unnecessary functionality is removed or
    disabled.
- Only required functionality, as documented in
    the configuration standards, is enabled.

```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
System components cannot be compromised by
exploiting unnecessary functionality present in the
system component.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Ensuring that all insecure services, protocols, and
daemons are adequately secured with
appropriate security features makes it more
difficult for malicious individuals to exploit
common points of compromise within a network.
Good Practice
Enabling security features before new system
components are deployed will prevent insecure
configurations from being introduced into the
environment. Some vendor solutions may provide
additional security functions to assist with
securing an insecure process.
Further Information
For guidance on services, protocols, or daemons
considered to be insecure, refer to industry
standards and guidance (for example, as
published by NIST, ENISA, and OWASP).
```
```
2.2.5 If any insecure services, protocols, or
daemons are present:
```
- Business justification is documented.
- Additional security features are documented and
    implemented that reduce the risk of using
    insecure services, protocols, or daemons.

```
2.2.5.a If any insecure services, protocols, or
daemons are present, examine system
configuration standards and interview personnel to
verify they are managed and implemented in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
2.2.5.b If any insecure services, protocols, or
daemons, are present, examine configuration
settings to verify that additional security features
are implemented to reduce the risk of using
insecure services, daemons, and protocols.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Correctly configuring security parameters
provided in system components takes advantage
of the capabilities of the system component to
defeat malicious attacks.
Good Practice
System configuration standards and related
processes should specifically address security
settings and parameters that have known security
implications for each type of system in use.
For systems to be configured securely, personnel
responsible for configuration and/or administering
systems should be knowledgeable in the specific
security parameters and settings that apply to the
system. Considerations should also include
secure settings for parameters used to access
cloud portals.
Further Information
Refer to vendor documentation and industry
references noted in Requirement 2.2.1 for
information about applicable security parameters
for each type of system.
```
```
2.2.6 System security parameters are configured to
prevent misuse.
```
```
2.2.6.a Examine system configuration standards to
verify they include configuring system security
parameters to prevent misuse.

2.2.6.b Interview system administrators and/or
security managers to verify they have knowledge
of common security parameter settings for system
components.
```

2.2.6.c Examine system configurations to verify
that common security parameters are set
appropriately and in accordance with the system
configuration standards.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If non-console (including remote) administration
does not use encrypted communications,
administrative authorization factors (such as IDs
and passwords) can be revealed to an
eavesdropper. A malicious individual could use
this information to access the network, become
administrator, and steal data.
Good Practice
Whichever security protocol is used, it should be
configured to use only secure versions and
configurations to prevent use of an insecure
connection—for example, by using only trusted
certificates, supporting only strong encryption,
and not supporting fallback to weaker, insecure
protocols or methods.
Examples
Cleartext protocols (such as HTTP, telnet, etc.) do
not encrypt traffic or logon details, making it easy
for an eavesdropper to intercept this information.
Non-console access may be facilitated by
technologies that provide alternative access to
systems, including but not limited to, out-of-band
(OOB), lights-out management (LOM), Intelligent
Platform Management Interface (IPMI), and
keyboard, video, mouse (KVM) switches with
remote capabilities. These and other non-console
access technologies and methods must be
secured with strong cryptography.
Further Information
Refer to industry standards and best practices
such as NIST SP 800-52 and SP 800-57.
```
```
2.2.7 All non-console administrative access is
encrypted using strong cryptography.

```
2.2.7.a Examine system configuration standards to
verify they include encrypting all non-console
administrative access using strong cryptography.
```
```
2.2.7.b Observe an administrator log on to system
components and examine system configurations to
verify that non-console administrative access is
managed in accordance with this requirement.
```
```
2.2.7.c Examine settings for system components
and authentication services to verify that insecure
remote login services are not available for non-
console administrative access.

2.2.7.d Examine vendor documentation and
interview personnel to verify that strong
cryptography for the technology in use is
implemented according to industry best practices
and/or vendor recommendations.

Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Cleartext administrative authorization factors cannot
be read or intercepted from any network
transmissions.

2.3 Wireless environments are configured and managed securely.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If wireless networks are not implemented with
sufficient security configurations (including
changing default settings), wireless sniffers can
eavesdrop on the traffic, easily capture data and
passwords, and easily enter and attack the
network.
Good Practice
Wireless passwords should be constructed so
that they are resistant to offline brute force
attacks.
```
```
2.3.1 For wireless environments connected to the
CDE or transmitting account data, all wireless
vendor defaults are changed at installation or are
confirmed to be secure, including but not limited to:
```
- Default wireless encryption keys.
- Passwords on wireless access points.
- SNMP defaults.
- Any other security-related wireless vendor
    defaults.

```
2.3.1.a Examine policies and procedures and
interview responsible personnel to verify that
processes are defined for wireless vendor defaults
to either change them upon installation or to
confirm them to be secure in accordance with all
elements of this requirement.
```
```
2.3.1.b Examine vendor documentation and
observe a system administrator logging into
wireless devices to verify:
```
- SNMP defaults are not used.
- Default passwords/passphrases on wireless
    access points are not used.

```
2.3.1.c Examine vendor documentation and
wireless configuration settings to verify other
security-related wireless vendor defaults were
changed, if applicable.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Wireless networks cannot be accessed using
vendor default passwords or default configurations.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This includes, but is not limited to, default wireless
encryption keys, passwords on wireless access
points, SNMP defaults, and any other security-
related wireless vendor defaults.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Changing wireless encryption keys whenever
someone with knowledge of the key leaves the
organization or moves to a role that no longer
requires knowledge of the key, helps keep
knowledge of keys limited to only those with a
business need to know.
Also, changing wireless encryption keys
whenever a key is suspected or known to be
comprised makes a wireless network more
resistant to compromise.
Good Practice
This goal can be accomplished in multiple ways,
including periodic changes of keys, changing keys
via a defined “joiners-movers-leavers” (JML)
process, implementing additional technical
controls, and not using fixed pre-shared keys.
In addition, any keys that are known to be, or
suspected of being, compromised should be
managed in accordance with the entity’s incident
response plan at Requirement 12.10.1.
```
```
2.3.2 For wireless environments connected to the
CDE or transmitting account data, wireless
encryption keys are changed as follows:
```
- Whenever personnel with knowledge of the key
    leave the company or the role for which the
    knowledge was necessary.
- Whenever a key is suspected of or known to be
    compromised.

```
2.3.2 Interview responsible personnel and examine
key-management documentation to verify that
wireless encryption keys are changed in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.

### Protect Account Data

**_Requirement 3: Protect Stored Account Data_**

```
Sections
```
```
3.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting stored account data are defined and understood.
3.2 Storage of account data is kept to a minimum.
3.3 Sensitive authentication data (SAD) is not stored after authorization.
3.4 Access to displays of full PAN and ability to copy cardholder data are restricted.
3.5 Primary account number (PAN) is secured wherever it is stored.
3.6 Cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data are secured.
3.7 Where cryptography is used to protect stored account data, key management processes and procedures covering all aspects of the key
lifecycle are defined and implemented.
```
```
Overview
```
```
Protection methods such as encryption, truncation, masking, and hashing are critical components of account data protection. If an intruder
circumvents other security controls and gains access to encrypted account data, the data is unreadable without the proper cryptographic keys
and is unusable to that intruder. Other effective methods of protecting stored data should also be considered as potential risk-mitigation
opportunities. For example, methods for minimizing risk include not storing account data unless necessary, truncating cardholder data if full
PAN is not needed, and not sending unprotected PANs using end-user messaging technologies such as e-mail and instant messaging.
```
```
If account data is present in non-persistent memory (for example, RAM, volatile memory), encryption of account data is not required. However,
proper controls must be in place to ensure that memory maintains a non-persistent state. Data should be removed from volatile memory once
the business purpose (for example, the associated transaction) is complete. In the case that data storage becomes persistent, all applicable PCI
DSS Requirements will apply including encryption of stored data.
```
```
Requirement 3 applies to protection of stored account data unless specifically called out in an individual requirement.
```
```
Refer to Appendix G for definitions of “strong cryptography” and other PCI DSS terms.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
3.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting stored account data are defined and understood.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 3.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 3.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 3, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives.
```
```
3.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 3 are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```
3.1.1 Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that security policies and
operational procedures identified in Requirement 3
are managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting
activities within Requirement 3 are defined and
adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting
activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and
conform to management’s intent.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities, and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
3.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing
activities in Requirement 3 are documented,
assigned, and understood.
```
```
3.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that
descriptions of roles and responsibilities
performing activities in Requirement 3 are
documented and assigned.
```
```
3.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility for
performing activities in Requirement 3 to verify that
roles and responsibilities are assigned as
documented and are understood.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```

Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the
activities in Requirement 3 are allocated. Personnel
are accountable for successful, continuous
operation of these requirements.

3.2 Storage of account data is kept to a minimum.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
A formal data retention policy identifies what data
needs to be retained, for how long, and where
that data resides so it can be securely destroyed
or deleted as soon as it is no longer needed. The
only account data that may be stored after
authorization is the primary account number or
PAN (rendered unreadable), expiration date,
cardholder name, and service code.
The storage of SAD data prior to the completion
of the authorization process is also included in the
data retention and disposal policy so that storage
of this sensitive data is kept to minimum, and only
retained for the defined amount of time.
Good Practice
When identifying locations of stored account data,
consider all processes and personnel with access
to the data, as data could have been moved and
stored in different locations than originally
defined. Storage locations that are often
overlooked include backup and archive systems,
removable data storage devices, paper-based
media, and audio recordings.
To define appropriate retention requirements, an
entity first needs to understand its own business
needs as well as any legal or regulatory
obligations that apply to its industry or to the type
of data being retained. Implementing an
automated process to ensure data is
automatically and securely deleted upon its
defined retention limit can help ensure that
account data is not retained beyond what is
necessary for business, legal, or regulatory
purposes.
(continued on next page)
```
```
3.2.1 Account data storage is kept to a minimum
through implementation of data retention and
disposal policies, procedures, and processes that
include at least the following:
```
- Coverage for all locations of stored account
    data.
- Coverage for any sensitive authentication data
    (SAD) stored prior to completion of authorization.
    _This bullet is a best practice until its effective_
    _date; refer to Applicability Notes below for_
    _details._
- Limiting data storage amount and retention time
    to that which is required for legal or regulatory,
    and/or business requirements.
- Specific retention requirements for stored
    account data that defines length of retention
    period and includes a documented business
    justification.
- Processes for secure deletion or rendering
    account data unrecoverable when no longer
    needed per the retention policy.
- A process for verifying, at least once every three
    months, that stored account data exceeding the
    defined retention period has been securely
    deleted or rendered unrecoverable.

```
3.2.1.a Examine the data retention and disposal
policies, procedures, and processes and interview
personnel to verify processes are defined to
include all elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
3.2.1.b Examine files and system records on
system components where account data is stored
to verify that the data storage amount and retention
time does not exceed the requirements defined in
the data retention policy.
```
```
3.2.1.c Observe the mechanisms used to render
account data unrecoverable to verify data cannot
be recovered.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```

Applicability Notes Methods of eliminating data when it exceeds the
retention period include secure deletion to
complete removal of the data or rendering it
unrecoverable and unable to be reconstructed.
Identifying and securely eliminating stored data
that has exceeded its specified retention period
prevents unnecessary retention of data that is no
longer needed. This process may be automated,
manual, or a combination of both.
The deletion function in most operating systems is
not “secure deletion” as it allows deleted data to
be recovered, so instead, a dedicated secure
deletion function or application must be used to
make data unrecoverable.
Remember, if you don't need it, don't store it!
Examples
An automated, programmatic procedure could be
run to locate and remove data, or a manual
review of data storage areas could be performed.
Whichever method is used, it is a good idea to
monitor the process to ensure it is completed
successfully, and that the results are recorded
and validated as being complete. Implementing
secure deletion methods ensures that the data
cannot be retrieved when it is no longer needed.

Media Sanitization.

Where account data is stored by a TPSP (for
example, in a cloud environment), entities are
responsible for working with their service providers
to understand how the TPSP meets this
requirement for the entity. Considerations include
ensuring that all geographic instances of a data
element are securely deleted.

3.4 Access to displays of full PAN and ability to copy PAN is restricted.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The display of full PAN on computer screens,
payment card receipts, paper reports, etc. can
result in this data being obtained by unauthorized
individuals and used fraudulently. Ensuring that
the full PAN is displayed only for those with a
legitimate business need minimizes the risk of
unauthorized persons gaining access to PAN
data.
Good Practice
Applying access controls according to defined
roles is one way to limit access to viewing full
PAN to only those individuals with a defined
business need.
The masking approach should always display
only the number of digits needed to perform a
specific business function. For example, if only
the last four digits are needed to perform a
business function, PAN should be masked to only
show the last four digits. As another example, if a
function needs to view to the bank identification
number (BIN) for routing purposes, unmask only
the BIN digits for that function.
Definitions
Masking is not synonymous with truncation and
these terms cannot be used interchangeably.
Masking refers to the concealment of certain
digits during display or printing, even when the
entire PAN is stored on a system. This is different
from truncation, in which the truncated digits are
removed and cannot be retrieved within the
system. Masked PAN could be “unmasked”, but
there is no "un-truncation" without recreating the
PAN from another source.
Further Information
For more information about masking and
truncation, see PCI SSC’s FAQs on these topics.
```
```
3.4.1 PAN is masked when displayed (the BIN and
last four digits are the maximum number of digits
to be displayed), such that only personnel with a
legitimate business need can see more than the
BIN and last four digits of the PAN.
```
```
3.4.1.a Examine documented policies and
procedures for masking the display of PANs to
verify:
```
- A list of roles that need access to more than
    the BIN and last four digits of the PAN
    (includes full PAN) is documented, together
    with a legitimate business need for each role
    to have such access.
- PAN is masked when displayed such that only
    personnel with a legitimate business need can
    see more than the BIN and last four digits of
    the PAN.
- All roles not specifically authorized to see the
    full PAN must only see masked PANs.

Applicability Notes 3.4.1.b^ Examine system configurations to verify
that full PAN is only displayed for roles with a
documented business need, and that PAN is

This requirement does not supersede stricter
requirements in place for displays of cardholder
data—for example, legal or payment brand
requirements for point-of-sale (POS) receipts.
This requirement relates to protection of PAN where
it is displayed on screens, paper receipts, printouts,

failure of a primary access control system leading
to a breach of confidentiality of stored PAN. If
hashing is used to remove stored cleartext PAN,
by correlating hashed and truncated versions of a
given PAN, a malicious individual can easily
derive the original PAN value. Controls that
prevent the correlation of this data will help

While disk encryption may still be present on these
types of devices, it cannot be the only mechanism
used to protect PAN stored on those systems. Any
stored PAN must also be rendered unreadable per
Requirement 3.5.1—for example, through truncation
or a data-level encryption mechanism. Full disk
encryption helps to protect data in the event of
physical loss of a disk and therefore its use is
appropriate only for removable electronic media
storage devices.
Media that is part of a data center architecture (for
example, hot-swappable drives, bulk tape-backups)
is considered non-removable electronic media to
which Requirement 3.5.1 applies.
Disk or partition encryption implementations must
also meet all other PCI DSS encryption and key-
management requirements.
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Disk-level encryption typically encrypts the entire
disk or partition using the same key, with all data
automatically decrypted when the system runs or
when an authorized user requests it. Many disk-
encryption solutions intercept operating system
read/write operations and perform the appropriate
cryptographic transformations without any special
action by the user other than supplying a
password or passphrase at system start-up or at
the beginning of a session. This provides no
protection from a malicious individual that has
already managed to gain access to a valid user
account.
Good Practice
Full disk encryption helps to protect data in the
event of physical loss of a disk and therefore its
use is best limited only to removable electronic
media storage devices.
```
```
3.5.1.3 If disk-level or partition-level encryption is
used (rather than file-, column-, or field--level
database encryption) to render PAN unreadable, it
is managed as follows:
```
- Logical access is managed separately and
    independently of native operating system
    authentication and access control
    mechanisms.
- Decryption keys are not associated with user
    accounts.
- Authentication factors (passwords,
    passphrases, or cryptographic keys) that allow
    access to unencrypted data are stored
    securely.

```
3.5.1.3.a If disk-level or partition-level encryption is
used to render PAN unreadable, examine the
system configuration and observe the
authentication process to verify that logical access
is implemented in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
3.5.1.3.b Examine files containing authentication
factors (passwords, passphrases, or cryptographic
keys) and interview personnel to verify that
authentication factors that allow access to
unencrypted data are stored securely and are
independent from the native operating system’s
authentication and access control methods.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Disk encryption implementations are configured to
require independent authentication and logical
access controls for decryption.
```
```
Applicability Notes

Disk or partition encryption implementations must
also meet all other PCI DSS encryption and key-
management requirements.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Cryptographic keys must be strongly protected
because those who obtain access will be able to
decrypt data.
Good Practice
Having a centralized key management system
based on industry standards is recommended for
managing cryptographic keys.

3.6.1 Procedures are defined and implemented to
protect cryptographic keys used to protect stored
account data against disclosure and misuse that
include:
```
- Access to keys is restricted to the fewest number
    of custodians necessary.
- Key-encrypting keys are at least as strong as the
    data-encrypting keys they protect.
- Key-encrypting keys are stored separately from
    data-encrypting keys.
- Keys are stored securely in the fewest possible
    locations and forms.

```
3.6.1 Examine documented key-management
policies and procedures to verify that processes to
protect cryptographic keys used to protect stored

```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement applies to keys used to encrypt
stored account data and to key-encrypting keys
used to protect data-encrypting keys.
The requirement to protect keys used to protect
stored account data from disclosure and misuse
applies to both data-encrypting keys and key-
encrypting keys. Because one key-encrypting key
may grant access to many data-encrypting keys, the
key-encrypting keys require strong protection
measures.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Maintaining current documentation of the
cryptographic architecture enables an entity to
understand the algorithms, protocols, and
cryptographic keys used to protect stored account
data, as well as the devices that generate, use,
and protect the keys. This allows an entity to keep
pace with evolving threats to its architecture and
plan for updates as the assurance level provided
by different algorithms and key strengths
changes. Maintaining such documentation also
allows an entity to detect lost or missing keys or
key-management devices and identify
unauthorized additions to its cryptographic
architecture.
The use of the same cryptographic keys in both
production and test environments introduces a
risk of exposing the key if the test environment is
not at the same security level as the production
environment.
Good Practice
Having an automated reporting mechanism can
assist with maintenance of the cryptographic
attributes.
```
```
3.6.1.1 Additional requirement for service
providers only: A documented description of the
cryptographic architecture is maintained that
includes:
```
- Details of all algorithms, protocols, and keys
    used for the protection of stored account data,
    including key strength and expiry date.
- Preventing the use of the same cryptographic
    keys in production and test environments. _This_
    _bullet is a best practice until its effective date;_
    _refer to Applicability Notes below for details._
- Description of the key usage for each key.
- Inventory of any hardware security modules
    (HSMs), key management systems (KMS), and
    other secure cryptographic devices (SCDs) used
    for key management, including type and location
    of devices, as outlined in Requirement 12.3.4.

```
3.6.1.1 Additional testing procedure for service
provider assessments only: Interview
responsible personnel and examine documentation
to verify that a document exists to describe the
cryptographic architecture that includes all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Accurate details of the cryptographic architecture
are maintained and available.
```
```
Applicability Notes^
```
```
This requirement applies only when the entity being
assessed is a service provider.
In cloud HSM implementations, responsibility for the
cryptographic architecture according to this
Requirement will be shared between the cloud
provider and the cloud customer.
The bullet above (for including, in the cryptographic
architecture, that the use of the same cryptographic
keys in production and test is prevented) is a best
practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be
required as part of Requirement 3.6.1.1 and must
be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Storing cryptographic keys securely prevents
unauthorized or unnecessary access that could
result in the exposure of stored account data.
Storing keys separately means they are stored
such that if the location of one key is
compromised, the second key is not also
compromised.
Good Practice
Where data-encrypting keys are stored in an
HSM, the HSM interaction channel should be
protected to prevent interception of encryption or
decryption operations.
```
```
3.6.1.2 Secret and private keys used to
encrypt/decrypt stored account data are stored in
one (or more) of the following forms at all times:
```
- Encrypted with a key-encrypting key that is at
    least as strong as the data-encrypting key, and
    that is stored separately from the data-
    encrypting key.
- Within a secure cryptographic device (SCD),
    such as a hardware security module (HSM) or
    PTS-approved point-of-interaction device.
- As at least two full-length key components or key
    shares, in accordance with an industry-accepted
    method.

```
3.6.1.2.a Examine documented procedures to
verify it is defined that cryptographic keys used to
encrypt/decrypt stored account data must exist
only in one (or more) of the forms specified in this
requirement.

3.6.1.2.b Examine system configurations and key
storage locations to verify that cryptographic keys
used to encrypt/decrypt stored account data exist
in one (or more) of the forms specified in this
requirement.
```
```
3.6.1.2.c Wherever key-encrypting keys are used,
examine system configurations and key storage
locations to verify:
```
- Key-encrypting keys are at least as strong as
    the data-encrypting keys they protect.
- Key-encrypting keys are stored separately from
    data-encrypting keys.

```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Secret and private keys are stored in a secure form
that prevents unauthorized retrieval or access.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
It is not required that public keys be stored in one of
these forms.
Cryptographic keys stored as part of a key
management system (KMS) that employs SCDs are
acceptable.
A cryptographic key that is split into two parts does
not meet this requirement. Secret or private keys
stored as key components or key shares must be
generated via one of the following:
```
- Using an approved random number generator
    and within an SCD,
    **OR**
- According to ISO 19592 or equivalent industry
    standard for generation of secret key shares.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Changing encryption keys when they reach the
end of their cryptoperiod is imperative to minimize
the risk of someone obtaining the encryption keys
and using them to decrypt data.
Definitions
A cryptoperiod is the time span during which a
cryptographic key can be used for its defined
purpose. Cryptoperiods are often defined in terms
of the period for which the key is active and/or the
amount of cipher-text that has been produced by
the key. Considerations for defining the
cryptoperiod include, but are not limited to, the
strength of the underlying algorithm, size or length
of the key, risk of key compromise, and the
sensitivity of the data being encrypted.
Further Information

Cryptoperiods - provides guidance for
establishing the time span during which a specific
key is authorized for use by legitimate entities, or
the keys for a given system will remain in effect.
See Table 1 of SP 800-57 Part 1 for suggested
cryptoperiods for different key types.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Keys that are no longer required, keys with
weakened integrity, and keys that are known or
suspected to be compromised, should be
archived, revoked, and/or destroyed to ensure
that the keys can no longer be used.
If such keys need to be kept (for example, to
support archived encrypted data), they should be
strongly protected.
Good Practice
Archived cryptographic keys should be used only
for decryption/verification purposes.
The encryption solution should provide for and
facilitate a process to replace keys that are due
for replacement or that are known to be, or
suspected of being, compromised. In addition,
any keys that are known to be, or suspected of
being, compromised should be managed in
accordance with the entity’s incident response
plan per Requirement 12.10.1.
Further Information
Industry best practices for archiving retired keys
are outlined in NIST SP 800-57 Part 1, Revision
5, Section 8.3.1 , and includes maintaining the
archive with a trusted third party and storing
archived key information separately from
operational data.

- The integrity of the key has been weakened,
    including when personnel with knowledge of a
    cleartext key component leaves the company, or
    the role for which the key component was
    known.
- The key is suspected of or known to be
    compromised.
Retired or replaced keys are not used for encryption
operations.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Split knowledge and dual control of keys are used
to eliminate the possibility of a single person
having access to the whole key and therefore
being able to gain unauthorized access to the
data.
Definitions
Split knowledge is a method in which two or more
people separately have key components, where
each person knows only their own key
component, and the individual key components
convey no knowledge of other components or of
the original cryptographic key.
Dual control requires two or more people to
authenticate the use of a cryptographic key or
perform a key-management function. No single
person can access or use the authentication
factor (for example, the password, PIN, or key) of
another.
Good Practice
Where key components or key shares are used,
procedures should ensure that no single
custodian ever has access to sufficient key
components or shares to reconstruct the
cryptographic key. For example, in an m-of-n
scheme (for example, Shamir), where only two of
any three components are required to reconstruct
the cryptographic key, a custodian must not have
current or prior knowledge of more than one
component. If a custodian was previously
assigned component A, which was then
reassigned, the custodian should not then be
assigned component B or C, as this would give
the custodian knowledge of two components and
the ability to recreate the key.
(continued on next page)
```
```
3.7.6 Where manual cleartext cryptographic key-
management operations are performed by
personnel, key-management policies and
procedures are implemented include managing
these operations using split knowledge and dual
control.
```
```
3.7.6.a Examine the documented key-management
policies and procedures for keys used for
protection of stored account data and verify that
they define using split knowledge and dual control.
```
```
3.7.6.b Interview personnel and/or observe
processes to verify that manual cleartext keys are
Customized Approach Objective managed with split knowledge and dual control.^
```
```
Cleartext secret or private keys cannot be known by
anyone. Operations involving cleartext keys cannot
be carried out by a single person.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This control is applicable for manual key-
management operations or where key management
is not controlled by the encryption product.
A cryptographic key that is simply split into two parts
does not meet this requirement. Secret or private
keys stored as key components or key shares must
be generated via one of the following:
```
- Using an approved random number generator
    and within a secure cryptographic device (SCD),
    such as a hardware security module (HSM) or
    PTS-approved point-of-interaction device,

4.2 PAN is protected with strong cryptography during transmission
```
```
Overview
```
```
The use of strong cryptography provides greater assurance in preserving data confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation.
```
```
To protect against compromise, PAN must be encrypted during transmission over networks that are easily accessed by malicious individuals,
including untrusted and public networks. Misconfigured wireless networks and vulnerabilities in legacy encryption and authentication protocols
continue to be targeted by malicious individuals aiming to exploit these vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to cardholder data environments
(CDE). Any transmissions of cardholder data over an entity’s internal network(s) will naturally bring that network into scope for PCI DSS since
that network stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data. Any such networks must be evaluated and assessed against applicable PCI DSS
requirements.
```
```
Requirement 4 applies to transmissions of PAN unless specifically called out in an individual requirement.
```
```
PAN transmissions can be protected by encrypting the data before it is transmitted, or by encrypting the session over which the data is
transmitted, or both. While it is not required that strong cryptography be applied at both the data level and the session level, it is recommended.
```
```

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 4.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 4.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 4, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives. Policies and procedures, including
updates, are actively communicated to all affected
personnel, and are supported by operating
procedures describing how to perform activities.
```
```
4.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 4 are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```
4.1.1 Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that security policies and
operational procedures identified in Requirement 4
are managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting
activities within Requirement 4 are defined and
adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting
activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and
conform to management’s intent.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
4.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing
activities in Requirement 4 are documented,
assigned, and understood.
```
```
4.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that
descriptions of roles and responsibilities for
performing activities in Requirement 4 are
documented and assigned.
```
```
4.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility for
performing activities in Requirement 4 to verify that
roles and responsibilities are assigned as
documented and are understood.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the
activities in Requirement 4 are allocated. Personnel
are accountable for successful, continuous
operation of these requirements.

4.2 PAN is protected with strong cryptography during transmission.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Sensitive information must be encrypted during
transmission over public networks because it is
easy and common for a malicious individual to
intercept and/or divert data while in transit.
Good Practice
The network and data-flow diagrams defined in
Requirement 1 are useful resources for identifying
all connection points where account data is
transmitted or received over open, public
networks.
While not required, it is considered a good
practice for entities to also encrypt PAN over their
internal networks, and for entities to establish any
new network implementations with encrypted
communications.
PAN transmissions can be protected by
encrypting the data before it is transmitted, or by
encrypting the session over which the data is
transmitted, or both. While it is not required that
strong cryptography be applied at both the data
level and the session level, it is strongly
recommended. If encrypted at the data level, the
cryptographic keys used for protecting the data
can be managed in accordance with
Requirements 3.6 and 3.7. If the data is encrypted
at the session level, designated key custodians
should be assigned responsibility for managing
transmission keys and certificates.
(continued on next page)
```
```
4.2.1 Strong cryptography and security protocols
are implemented as follows to safeguard PAN
during transmission over open, public networks:
```
- Only trusted keys and certificates are accepted.
- Certificates used to safeguard PAN during
    transmission over open, public networks are
    confirmed as valid and are not expired or
    revoked. _This bullet is a best practice until its_
    _effective date; refer to applicability notes below_
    _for details._
- The protocol in use supports only secure
    versions or configurations and does not support
    fallback to, or use of insecure versions,
    algorithms, key sizes, or implementations.
- The encryption strength is appropriate for the
    encryption methodology in use.

```
4.2.1.a Examine documented policies and
procedures and interview personnel to verify
processes are defined to include all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
4.2.1.b Examine system configurations to verify
that strong cryptography and security protocols are
implemented in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
4.2.1.c Examine cardholder data transmissions to
verify that all PAN is encrypted with strong
cryptography when it is transmitted over open,
public networks.
```
```
4.2.1.d Examine system configurations to verify
that keys and/or certificates that cannot be verified
as trusted are rejected.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Cleartext PAN cannot be read or intercepted from
any transmissions over open, public networks.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Applicability Notes^ Some protocol implementations (such as SSL,
SSH v1.0, and early TLS) have known
vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to gain
access to the cleartext data. It is critical that
entities maintain awareness of industry-defined
deprecation dates for the cipher suites they are
using and are prepared to migrate to newer
versions or protocols when older ones are no
longer deemed secure.
Verifying that certificates are trusted helps ensure
the integrity of the secure connection. To be
considered trusted, a certificate should be issued
from a trusted source, such as a trusted certificate
authority (CA), and not be expired. Up-to-date
Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online
Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) can be used to
validate certificates.
Techniques to validate certificates may include
certificate and public key pinning, where the
trusted certificate or a public key is pinned either
during development or upon its first use. Entities
can also confirm with developers or review source
code to ensure that clients and servers reject
connections if the certificate is bad.
For browser-based TLS certificates, certificate
trust can often be verified by clicking on the lock
icon that appears next to the address bar.
(continued on next page)
```
```
There could be occurrences where an entity
receives cardholder data unsolicited via an insecure
communication channel that was not intended for
the purpose of receiving sensitive data. In this
situation, the entity can choose to either include the
channel in the scope of their CDE and secure it
according to PCI DSS or implement measures to
prevent the channel from being used for cardholder
data.
A self-signed certificate may also be acceptable if
the certificate is issued by an internal CA within the
organization, the certificate’s author is confirmed,
and the certificate is verified—for example, via hash
or signature—and has not expired. Note that self-
signed certificates where the Distinguished Name
(DN) field in the “issued by” and “issued to” field is
the same are not acceptable.
The bullet above (for confirming that certificates
used to safeguard PAN during transmission over
open, public networks are valid and are not expired
or revoked) is a best practice until 31 March 2025,
after which it will be required as part of Requirement
4.2.1 and must be fully considered during a PCI
DSS assessment.
```

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The inventory of trusted keys helps the entity
keep track of the algorithms, protocols, key
strength, key custodians, and key expiry dates.
This enables the entity to respond quickly to
vulnerabilities discovered in encryption software,
certificates, and cryptographic algorithms.
Good Practice
For certificates, the inventory should include the
issuing CA and certification expiration date.
```
```
4.2.1.1 An inventory of the entity’s trusted keys and
certificates used to protect PAN during transmission
is maintained.
```
```

procedures to verify processes are defined for the
entity to maintain an inventory of its trusted keys
and certificates.
```
```
4.2.1.1.b Examine the inventory of trusted keys
and certificates to verify it is kept up to date.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
All keys and certificates used to protect PAN during
transmission are identified and confirmed as trusted.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Since wireless networks do not require physical
media to connect, it is important to establish
controls limiting who can connect and what
transmission protocols will be used. Malicious
users use free and widely available tools to
eavesdrop on wireless communications. Use of
strong cryptography can help limit disclosure of
sensitive information across wireless networks.
Wireless networks present unique risks to an
organization; therefore, they must be identified
and protected according to industry requirements.
Strong cryptography for authentication and
transmission of PAN is required to prevent
malicious users from gaining access to the
wireless network or utilizing wireless networks to
access other internal networks or data.
Good Practice
Wireless networks should not permit fallback or
downgrade to an insecure protocol or lower
encryption strength that does not meet the intent
of strong cryptography.
Further Information
Review the vendor’s specific documentation for
more details on the choice of protocols,
configurations, and settings related to
cryptography.
```
```
4.2.1.2 Wireless networks transmitting PAN or
connected to the CDE use industry best practices to
implement strong cryptography for authentication
and transmission.

```
4.2.1.2 Examine system configurations to verify
that wireless networks transmitting PAN or
connected to the CDE use industry best practices
to implement strong cryptography for
authentication and transmission.
Customized Approach Objective

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
End-user messaging technologies typically can be
easily intercepted by packet-sniffing during
delivery across internal and public networks.
Good Practice
The use of end-user messaging technology to
send PAN should only be considered where there
is a defined business need.
Examples
E-mail, instant messaging, SMS, and chat are
examples of the type of end-user messaging
technology that this requirement refers to.
```
```
4.2.2 PAN is secured with strong cryptography
whenever it is sent via end-user messaging
technologies.
```
```
4.2.2.a Examine documented policies and
procedures to verify that processes are defined to
secure PAN with strong cryptography whenever
sent over end-user messaging technologies.
```
```
4.2.2.b Examine system configurations and vendor
documentation to verify that PAN is secured with
strong cryptography whenever it is sent via end-
user messaging technologies.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Cleartext PAN cannot be read or intercepted from
transmissions using end-user messaging
technologies.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement also applies if a customer, or other
third-party, requests that PAN is sent to them via
end-user messaging technologies.
There could be occurrences where an entity
receives unsolicited cardholder data via an insecure
communication channel that was not intended for
transmissions of sensitive data. In this situation, the
entity can choose to either include the channel in
the scope of their CDE and secure it according to
PCI DSS or delete the cardholder data and
implement measures to prevent the channel from
being used for cardholder data.

5.3 Anti-malware mechanisms and processes are active, maintained, and monitored.
5.4 Anti-phishing mechanisms protect users against phishing attacks.
```
```
Overview
```
```
Malicious software (malware) is software or firmware designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without the owner's knowledge or
consent, with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the owner’s data, applications, or operating system.
```
```
Examples include viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, ransomware, keyloggers, and rootkits, malicious code, scripts, and links.
```
```
Malware can enter the network during many business-approved activities, including employee e-mail (for example, via phishing) and use of the
Internet, mobile computers, and storage devices, resulting in the exploitation of system vulnerabilities.
```
```
Using anti-malware solutions that address all types of malware helps to protect systems from current and evolving malware threats.

There is a constant stream of attacks targeting
newly discovered vulnerabilities in systems
previously regarded as secure. Without an anti-
malware solution that is updated regularly, new
forms of malware can be used to attack systems,

Good Practice
It is beneficial for entities to be aware of "zero-
day" attacks (those that exploit a previously
unknown vulnerability) and consider solutions that
focus on behavioral characteristics and will alert
and react to unexpected behavior.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Certain systems, at a given point in time, may not
currently be commonly targeted or affected by
malware. However, industry trends for malware
can change quickly, so it is important for
organizations to be aware of new malware that
might affect their systems—for example, by
monitoring vendor security notices and anti-
malware forums to determine whether its systems
might be coming under threat from new and
evolving malware.
Good Practice
If an entity determines that a particular system is
not susceptible to any malware, the determination
should be supported by industry evidence, vendor
resources, and best practices.
The following steps can help entities during their
periodic evaluations:
```
- Identification of all system types previously
    determined to not require malware protection.
- Review of industry vulnerability alerts and
    notices to determine if new threats exist for
    any identified system.
- A documented conclusion about whether the
    system types remain not susceptible to
    malware.
- A strategy to add malware protection for any
    system types for which malware protection has
    become necessary.
Trends in malware should be included in the
identification of new security vulnerabilities at
Requirement 6.3.1, and methods to address new
trends should be incorporated into the entity’s
configuration standards and protection
mechanisms as needed.

    malware threats for those system components.
- Confirmation whether such system components
    continue to not require anti-malware protection.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
For an anti-malware solution to remain effective, it
needs to have the latest security updates,
signatures, threat analysis engines, and any other
malware protections on which the solution relies.
Having an automated update process avoids
burdening end users with responsibility for
manually installing updates and provides greater
assurance that anti-malware protection
mechanisms are updated as quickly as possible
after an update is released.
Good Practice
Anti-malware mechanisms should be updated via
a trusted source as soon as possible after an
update is available. Using a trusted common
source to distribute updates to end-user systems
helps ensure the integrity and consistency of the
solution architecture.
Updates may be automatically downloaded to a
central location—for example, to allow for
testing—prior to being deployed to individual
system components.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Periodic scans can identify malware that is
present, but currently inactive, within the
environment. Some malware, such as zero-day
malware, can enter an environment before the
scan solution is capable of detecting it.
Performing regular periodic scans or continuous
behavioral analysis of systems or processes
helps ensure that previously undetectable
malware can be identified, removed, and
investigated to determine how it gained access to
the environment.
Good Practice
Using a combination of periodic scans (scheduled
and on-demand) and active, real-time (on-access)
scanning helps ensure that malware residing in
both static and dynamic elements of the CDE is
addressed. Users should also be able to run on-
demand scans on their systems if suspicious
activity is detected – this can be useful in the
early detection of malware.
Scans should include the entire file system,
including all disks, memory, and start-up files and
boot records (at system restart) to detect all
malware upon file execution, including any
software that may be resident on a system but not
currently active. Scan scope should include all
systems and software in the CDE, including those
that are often overlooked such as email servers,
web browsers, and instant messaging software.
Definitions
Active, or real-time, scanning checks files for
malware upon any attempt to open, close,
rename, or otherwise interact with a file,
preventing the malware from being activated.

It is important to track the effectiveness of the
anti-malware mechanisms—for example, by
confirming that updates and scans are being

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
It is important that defensive mechanisms are
always running so that malware is detected in real
time. Ad-hoc starting and stopping of anti-
malware solutions could allow malware to
propagate unchecked and undetected.
Good Practice
Where there is a legitimate need to temporarily
disable a system’s anti-malware protection—for
example, to support a specific maintenance
activity or investigation of a technical problem—
the reason for taking such action should be
understood and approved by an appropriate
management representative. Any disabling or
altering of anti-malware mechanisms, including on
administrators’ own devices, should be performed
by authorized personnel. It is recognized that
administrators have privileges that may allow
them to disable anti-malware on their own
computers, but there should be alerting
mechanisms in place when such software is
disabled and then follow up that occurs to ensure
correct processes were followed.
Examples
Additional security measures that may need to be
implemented for the period during which anti-
malware protection is not active include
disconnecting the unprotected system from the
Internet while the anti-malware protection is
disabled and running a full scan once it is re-
enabled.
```
```
5.3.5 Anti-malware mechanisms cannot be disabled
or altered by users, unless specifically documented,
and authorized by management on a case-by-case
basis for a limited time period.

Customized Approach Objective 5.3.5.b^ Interview responsible personnel and
observe processes to verify that any requests to
disable or alter anti-malware mechanisms are
specifically documented and authorized by

time period.
```
```
Anti-malware mechanisms cannot be modified by
unauthorized personnel.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
Anti-malware solutions may be temporarily disabled
only if there is a legitimate technical need, as
authorized by management on a case-by-case
basis. If anti-malware protection needs to be
disabled for a specific purpose, it must be formally
authorized. Additional security measures may also
need to be implemented for the period during which
anti-malware protection is not active.

5.4 Anti-phishing mechanisms protect users against phishing attacks.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Technical controls can limit the number of
occasions personnel have to evaluate the veracity
of a communication and can also limit the effects
of individual responses to phishing.
Good Practice
When developing anti-phishing controls, entities
are encouraged to consider a combination of
approaches. For example, using anti-spoofing
controls such as Domain-based Message
Authentication, Reporting & Conformance
(DMARC), Sender Policy Framework (SPF), and
Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) will help stop
phishers from spoofing the entity’s domain and
impersonating personnel.
The deployment of technologies for blocking
phishing emails and malware before they reach
personnel, such as link scrubbers and server-side
anti-malware, can reduce incidents and decrease
the time required by personnel to check and
report phishing attacks. Additionally, training
personnel to recognize and report phishing emails
can allow similar emails to be identified and
permit them to be removed before being opened.
It is recommended (but not required) that anti-
phishing controls are applied across an entity’s
entire organization.

5.4.1 Processes and automated mechanisms are in
place to detect and protect personnel against

This requirement applies to the automated
mechanism. It is not intended that the systems and
services providing such automated mechanisms
(such as email servers) are brought into scope for
PCI DSS.
The focus of this requirement is on protecting
personnel with access to system components in-
scope for PCI DSS.
Meeting this requirement for technical and
automated controls to detect and protect personnel
against phishing is not the same as Requirement
12.6.3.1 for security awareness training. Meeting
this requirement does not also meet the requirement
for providing personnel with security awareness
training, and vice versa.
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

Definitions
Phishing is a form of social engineering and
describes the different methods used by attackers
to trick personnel into disclosing sensitive
information, such as user account names and
passwords, and account data. Attackers will
typically disguise themselves and attempt to
appear as a genuine or trusted source, directing
personnel to send an email response, click on a
web link, or enter data into a compromised
website. Mechanisms that can detect and prevent
phishing attempts are often included in anti-
malware solutions.

**_Requirement 6: Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Software_**

```
Sections
```
```
6.1 Processes and mechanisms for developing and maintaining secure systems and software are defined and understood.
6.2 Bespoke and custom software are developed securely.
6.3 Security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.
6.4 Public-facing web applications are protected against attacks.
6.5 Changes to all system components are managed securely.
```
```
Overview
```
```
Actors with bad intentions can use security vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to systems. Many of these vulnerabilities are fixed by vendor
provided security patches, which must be installed by the entities that manage the systems. All system components must have all appropriate
software patches to protect against the exploitation and compromise of account data by malicious individuals and malicious software.
```
```
Appropriate software patches are those patches that have been evaluated and tested sufficiently to determine that the patches do not conflict
with existing security configurations. For bespoke and custom software, numerous vulnerabilities can be avoided by applying software lifecycle
(SLC) processes and secure coding techniques.
```
```
Code repositories that store application code, system configurations, or other configuration data that can impact the security of account data or
the CDE are in scope for PCI DSS assessments.
```
```
See Relationship between PCI DSS and PCI SSC Software Standards on page 7 for information about the use of PCI SSC-validated software
and software vendors, and how use of PCI SSC’s software standards may help with meeting controls in Requirement 6.
```
```
Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.

Note : Requirement 6 applies to all system components, except for section 6.2 for developing software securely, which applies only to bespoke
and custom software used on any system component included in or connected to the CDE.

6.1 Processes and mechanisms for developing and maintaining secure systems and software are defined and understood.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 6.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 6.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 6, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives.
```
```
6.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 6 are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```
6.1.1 Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that security policies and
operational procedures identified in Requirement 6
are managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting
activities within Requirement 6 are defined and
adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting
activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and
conform to management’s intent.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, systems will not be securely
maintained, and their security level will be
reduced.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
6.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing
activities in Requirement 6 are documented,
assigned, and understood.

performing activities in Requirement 6 to verify that
roles and responsibilities are assigned as
documented and are understood.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective

Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the
activities in Requirement 6 are allocated. Personnel
are accountable for successful, continuous
operation of these requirements.

6.2 Bespoke and custom software are developed securely.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without the inclusion of security during the
requirements definition, design, analysis, and
testing phases of software development, security
vulnerabilities can be inadvertently or maliciously
introduced into the production environment.
Good Practice
Understanding how sensitive data is handled by
the application—including when stored,
transmitted, and in memory—can help identify
where data needs to be protected.
PCI DSS requirements must be considered when
developing software to meet those requirements
by design, rather than trying to retrofit the
software later.
Examples
Secure software lifecycle management
methodologies and frameworks include PCI
Software Security Framework, BSIMM,
OPENSAMM, and works from NIST, ISO, and
SAFECode.
```
```
6.2.1 Bespoke and custom software are developed
securely, as follows:
```
- Based on industry standards and/or best
    practices for secure development.
- In accordance with PCI DSS (for example,
    secure authentication and logging).
- Incorporating consideration of information
    security issues during each stage of the software
    development lifecycle.

```
6.2.1 Examine documented software development
procedures to verify that processes are defined
that include all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Bespoke and custom software is developed in
accordance with PCI DSS and secure development
processes throughout the software lifecycle.
```
```
Applicability Notes

This applies to all software developed for or by the
entity for the entity’s own use. This includes both
bespoke and custom software. This does not apply
to third-party software.
```

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Having staff knowledgeable in secure coding
methods, including techniques defined in
Requirement 6.2.4, will help minimize the number
of security vulnerabilities introduced through poor
coding practices.
Good Practice
Training for developers may be provided in-house
or by third parties.
Training should include, but is not limited to,
development languages in use, secure software
design, secure coding techniques, use of
techniques/methods for finding vulnerabilities in
code, processes to prevent reintroducing
previously resolved vulnerabilities, and how to
use any automated security testing tools for
detecting vulnerabilities in software.
As industry-accepted secure coding practices
change, organizational coding practices and
developer training may need to be updated to
address new threats.
```
```
6.2.2 Software development personnel working on
bespoke and custom software are trained at least
once every 12 months as follows:
```
- On software security relevant to their job function
    and development languages.
- Including secure software design and secure
    coding techniques.
- Including, if security testing tools are used, how
    to use the tools for detecting vulnerabilities in
    software.

```
6.2.2.a Examine software development procedures
to verify that processes are defined for training of
software development personnel developing
bespoke and custom software that includes all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
6.2.2.b Examine training records and interview
personnel to verify that software development
personnel working on bespoke and custom
software received software security training that is
relevant to their job function and development
languages in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Software development personnel remain
knowledgeable about secure development
practices; software security; and attacks against the
languages, frameworks, or applications they
develop. Personnel are able to access assistance
and guidance when required.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Security vulnerabilities in bespoke and custom
software are commonly exploited by malicious
individuals to gain access to a network and
compromise account data.
Vulnerable code is far more difficult and
expensive to address after it has been deployed
or released into production environments.
Requiring a formal review and signoff by
management prior to release helps to ensure that
code is approved and has been developed in
accordance with policies and procedures.
Good Practice
The following items should be considered for
inclusion in code reviews:
```
- Searching for undocumented features (implant
    tools, backdoors).
- Confirming that software securely uses
    external components’ functions (libraries,
    frameworks, APIs, etc.). For example, if a
    third-party library providing cryptographic
    functions is used, verify that it was integrated
    securely.
- Checking for correct use of logging to prevent
    sensitive data from getting into logs.
- Analysis of insecure code structures that may
    contain potential vulnerabilities related to
    common software attacks identified in
    Requirements 6.2.5.
- Checking the application’s behavior to detect
    logical vulnerabilities.

```
6.2.3 Bespoke and custom software is reviewed
prior to being released into production or to
customers, to identify and correct potential coding
vulnerabilities, as follows:
```
- Code reviews ensure code is developed
    according to secure coding guidelines.
- Code reviews look for both existing and
    emerging software vulnerabilities.
- Appropriate corrections are implemented prior to
    release.

```
6.2.3.a Examine documented software
development procedures and interview responsible
personnel to verify that processes are defined that
require all bespoke and custom software to be
reviewed in accordance with all elements specified
in this requirement.
```
```
6.2.3.b Examine evidence of changes to bespoke
and custom software to verify that the code
changes were reviewed in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Bespoke and custom software cannot be exploited
via coding vulnerabilities.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement for code reviews applies to all
bespoke and custom software (both internal and
public-facing), as part of the system development
lifecycle.
Public-facing web applications are also subject to
additional controls, to address ongoing threats and
vulnerabilities after implementation, as defined at
PCI DSS Requirement 6.4.
Code reviews may be performed using either
manual or automated processes, or a combination
of both.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Having code reviewed by someone other than the
original author, who is both experienced in code
reviews and knowledgeable about secure coding
practices, minimizes the possibility that code
containing security or logic errors that could affect
the security of cardholder data is released into a
production environment. Requiring management
approval that the code was reviewed limits the
ability for the process to be bypassed.
Good Practice
Having a formal review methodology and review
checklists has been found to improve the quality
of the code review process.
Code review is a tiring process, and for this
reason, it is most effective when reviewers only
review small amounts of code at a time.
To maintain the effectiveness of code reviews, it
is beneficial to monitor the general workload of
reviewers and to have them review applications
they are familiar with.
Code reviews may be performed using either
manual or automated processes, or a
combination of both.
Entitles that rely solely on manual code review
should ensure that reviewers maintain their skills
through regular training as new vulnerabilities are
found, and new secure coding methods are
recommended.
Further Information
See the OWASP Code Review Guide.
```
```
6.2.3.1 If manual code reviews are performed for
bespoke and custom software prior to release to
production, code changes are:
```
- Reviewed by individuals other than the
    originating code author, and who are
    knowledgeable about code-review techniques
    and secure coding practices.
- Reviewed and approved by management prior to
    release.

```
6.2.3.1.a If manual code reviews are performed for
bespoke and custom software prior to release to

Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The manual code review process cannot be
bypassed and is effective at discovering security
vulnerabilities.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
Manual code reviews can be conducted by
knowledgeable internal personnel or knowledgeable
third-party personnel.
An individual that has been formally granted
accountability for release control and who is neither

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Detecting or preventing common errors that result
in vulnerable code as early as possible in the
software development process lowers the
probability that such errors make it through to
production and lead to a compromise. Having
formal engineering techniques and tools
embedded in the development process will catch
these errors early. This philosophy is sometimes
called “shifting security left .”
Good Practice
For both bespoke and custom software, the entity
must ensure that code is developed focusing on
the prevention or mitigation of common software
attacks, including:
```
- Attempts to exploit common coding
    vulnerabilities (bugs).
- Attempts to exploit software design flaws.
- Attempts to exploit
    implementation/configuration flaws.
- Enumeration attacks – automated attacks that
    are actively exploited in payments and abuse
    identification, authentication, or authorization
    mechanisms. See the _PCI Perspectives blog_
    _article “Beware of Account Testing Attacks_ .”
Researching and documenting software
engineering techniques or other methods helps to
define how software developers prevent or
mitigate various software attacks by features or
countermeasures they build into software. This
might include identification/authentication
mechanisms, access control, input validation
routines, etc. Developers should be familiar with
different types of vulnerabilities and potential
attacks and use measures to avoid potential
attack vectors when developing code.
_(continued on next page)_

```
6.2.4 Software engineering techniques or other
methods are defined and in use by software
development personnel to prevent or mitigate
common software attacks and related vulnerabilities
in bespoke and custom software, including but not
limited to the following:
```
- Injection attacks, including SQL, LDAP, XPath,
    or other command, parameter, object, fault, or
    injection-type flaws.
- Attacks on data and data structures, including
    attempts to manipulate buffers, pointers, input
    data, or shared data.
- Attacks on cryptography usage, including
    attempts to exploit weak, insecure, or
    inappropriate cryptographic implementations,
    algorithms, cipher suites, or modes of operation.
- Attacks on business logic, including attempts to
    abuse or bypass application features and
    functionalities through the manipulation of APIs,
    communication protocols and channels, client-
    side functionality, or other system/application
    functions and resources. This includes cross-site
    scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery
    (CSRF).
- Attacks on access control mechanisms, including
    attempts to bypass or abuse identification,

6.3 Security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Classifying the risks (for example, as critical, high,
medium, or low) allows organizations to identify,
prioritize, and address the highest risk items more
quickly and reduce the likelihood that
vulnerabilities posing the greatest risk will be
exploited.
Good Practice
Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and
assigning risk ratings will vary based on an
organization’s environment and risk-assessment
strategy.
When an entity is assigning its risk rankings, it
should consider using a formal, objective,
justifiable methodology that accurately portrays
the risks of the vulnerabilities pertinent to the
organization and translates to an appropriate
entity-assigned priority for resolution.
An organization’s processes for managing
vulnerabilities should be integrated with other
management processes—for example, risk
management, change management, patch
management, incident response, application
security, as well as proper monitoring and logging
of these processes. This will help to ensure all
vulnerabilities are properly identified and
addressed. Processes should support ongoing
evaluation of vulnerabilities. For example, a
vulnerability initially identified as low risk could
become a higher risk later. Additionally,
vulnerabilities, individually considered to be low or
medium risk, could collectively pose a high or
critical risk if present on the same system, or if
exploited on a low-risk system that could result in
access to the CDE.
(continued on next page)
```
```
6.3.1 Security vulnerabilities are identified and
managed as follows:
```
- New security vulnerabilities are identified using
    industry-recognized sources for security
    vulnerability information, including alerts from
    international and national computer emergency
    response teams (CERTs).
- Vulnerabilities are assigned a risk ranking based
    on industry best practices and consideration of
    potential impact.
- Risk rankings identify, at a minimum, all
    vulnerabilities considered to be a high-risk or
    critical to the environment.
- Vulnerabilities for bespoke and custom, and
    third-party software (for example operating
    systems and databases) are covered.

```
6.3.1.a Examine policies and procedures for
identifying and managing security vulnerabilities to
verify that processes are defined in accordance
with all elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
6.3.1.b Interview responsible personnel, examine
documentation, and observe processes to verify
that security vulnerabilities are identified and
managed in accordance with all elements specified
in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
New system and software vulnerabilities that may
impact the security of account data or the CDE are
monitored, cataloged, and risk assessed.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is not achieved by, nor is it the
same as, vulnerability scans performed for
Requirements 11.3.1 and 11.3.2. This requirement
is for a process to actively monitor industry sources
for vulnerability information and for the entity to
determine the risk ranking to be associated with
each vulnerability.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Examples
Some organizations that issue alerts to advise
entities about urgent vulnerabilities requiring
immediate patches/updates are national
Computer Emergency Readiness/Response
Teams (CERTs) and vendors.
Criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include
criticality of a vulnerability identified in an alert
from Forum of Incident Response and Security
Teams (FIRST) or a CERT, consideration of the
CVSS score, the classification by the vendor,
and/or type of systems affected.
```
```
Further Information
Trustworthy sources for vulnerability information
include vendor websites, industry newsgroups,
mailing lists, etc. If software is developed in-
house, the internal development team should also
consider sources of information about new
vulnerabilities that may affect internally developed
applications. Other methods to ensure new
vulnerabilities are identified include solutions that
automatically recognize and alert upon detection
of unusual behavior. Processes should account
for widely published exploits as well as “zero-day”
attacks, which target previously unknown
vulnerabilities.
For bespoke and custom software, the
organization may obtain information about
libraries, frameworks, compilers, programming
languages, etc. from public trusted sources (for
example, special resources and resources from
component developers). The organization may
also independently analyze third-party
components and identify vulnerabilities.
(continued on next page)
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
For control over in-house developed software, the
organization may receive such information from
external sources. The organization can consider
using a “bug bounty” program where it posts
information (for example, on its website) so third
parties can contact the organization with
vulnerability information. External sources may
include independent investigators or companies
that report to the organization about identified
vulnerabilities and may include sources such as
the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) or the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Identifying and listing all the entity’s bespoke and
custom software, and any third-party software that
is incorporated into the entity’s bespoke and
custom software enables the entity to manage
vulnerabilities and patches.
Vulnerabilities in third-party components
(including libraries, APIs, etc.) embedded in an
entity’s software also renders those applications
vulnerable to attacks. Knowing which third-party
components are used in the entity’s software and
monitoring the availability of security patches to
address known vulnerabilities is critical to
ensuring the security of the software.
Good Practice
An entity’s inventory should cover all payment
software components and dependencies,
including supported execution platforms or
environments, third-party libraries, services, and
other required functionalities.
There are many different types of solutions that
can help with managing software inventories,
such as software composition analysis tools,
application discovery tools, and mobile device
management.
```
```
6.3.2 An inventory of bespoke and custom software,
and third-party software components incorporated
into bespoke and custom software is maintained to
facilitate vulnerability and patch management.
```
```
6.3.2.a Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that an inventory of bespoke
and custom software and third-party software
components incorporated into bespoke and custom
software is maintained, and that the inventory is
used to identify and address vulnerabilities.
```
```
6.3.2.b Examine software documentation, including
for bespoke and custom software that integrates
third-party software components, and compare it to
the inventory to verify that the inventory includes
the bespoke and custom software and third-party
software components.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Known vulnerabilities in third-party software
components cannot be exploited in bespoke and
custom software.
```
```

This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
New exploits are constantly being discovered,
and these can permit attacks against systems that
have previously been considered secure. If the
most recent security patches/updates are not
implemented on critical systems as soon as
possible, a malicious actor can use these exploits
to attack or disable a system or gain access to
sensitive data.
Good Practice
Prioritizing security patches/updates for critical
infrastructure ensures that high-priority systems
and devices are protected from vulnerabilities as
soon as possible after a patch is released.
An entity’s patching cadence should factor in any
re-evaluation of vulnerabilities and subsequent
changes in the criticality of a vulnerability per
Requirement 6.3.1. For example, a vulnerability
initially identified as low risk could become a
higher risk later. Additionally, vulnerabilities
individually considered to be low or medium risk
could collectively pose a high or critical risk if
present on the same system, or if exploited on a
low-risk system that could result in access to the
CDE.
```
```
6.3.3 All system components are protected from
known vulnerabilities by installing applicable
security patches/updates as follows:
```
- Critical or high-security patches/updates
    (identified according to the risk ranking process
    at Requirement 6.3.1) are installed within one
    month of release.
- All other applicable security patches/updates are
    installed within an appropriate time frame as
    determined by the entity (for example, within
    three months of release).

```
6.3.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verify
processes are defined for addressing
vulnerabilities by installing applicable security
patches/updates in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
6.3.3.b Examine system components and related
software and compare the list of installed security
patches/updates to the most recent security
patch/update information to verify vulnerabilities
are addressed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.

6.4 Public-facing web applications are protected against attacks.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Public-facing web applications are those that are
available to the public (not only for internal use).
These applications are primary targets for
attackers, and poorly coded web applications
provide an easy path for attackers to gain access
to sensitive data and systems.
Good Practice
Manual or automated vulnerability security
assessment tools or methods review and/or test
the application for vulnerabilities.
Common assessment tools include specialized
web scanners that perform automatic analysis of
web application protection.
When using automated technical solutions, it is
important to include processes that facilitate
timely responses to alerts generated by the
solutions so that any detected attacks can be
mitigated.
Examples
A web application firewall (WAF) installed in front
of public-facing web applications to check all
traffic is an example of an automated technical
solution that detects and prevents web-based
attacks (for example, the attacks included in
Requirement 6.2.4). WAFs filter and block non-
essential traffic at the application layer. A properly
configured WAF helps to prevent application-layer
attacks on applications that are improperly coded
or configured.
(continued on next page)
```
```
6.4.1 For public-facing web applications, new
threats and vulnerabilities are addressed on an
ongoing basis and these applications are protected
against known attacks as follows:
```
- Reviewing public-facing web applications via
    manual or automated application vulnerability
    security assessment tools or methods as follows:
       - At least once every 12 months and after
          significant changes.
       - By an entity that specializes in application
          security.
       - Including, at a minimum, all common
          software attacks in Requirement 6.2.4.
       - All vulnerabilities are ranked in accordance
          with requirement 6.3.1.
       - All vulnerabilities are corrected.
       - The application is re-evaluated after the
          corrections
**OR**
- Installing an automated technical solution(s) that
    continually detects and prevents web-based
    attacks as follows:
       - Installed in front of public-facing web
          applications to detect and prevent web-
          based attacks.
       - Actively running and up to date as
          applicable.
       - Generating audit logs.
       - Configured to either block web-based
          attacks or generate an alert that is
          immediately investigated.

```
6.4.1 For public-facing web applications, ensure
that either one of the required methods is in place
as follows:
```
- If manual or automated vulnerability security
    assessment tools or methods are in use,
    examine documented processes, interview
    personnel, and examine records of application
    security assessments to verify that public-facing
    web applications are reviewed in accordance
    with all elements of this requirement specific to
    the tool/method.
**OR**
- If an automated technical solution(s) is installed
that continually detects and prevents web-
based attacks, examine the system
configuration settings and audit logs, and
interview responsible personnel to verify that
the automated technical solution(s) is installed
in accordance with all elements of this
requirement specific to the solution(s).


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Customized Approach Objective^ Another example of an automated technical
solution is Runtime Application Self-Protection
(RASP) technologies. When implemented
correctly, RASP solutions can detect and block
anomalous behavior by the software during
execution. While WAFs typically monitor the
application perimeter, RASP solutions monitor
and block behavior within the application.

Good Practice
When using automated technical solutions, it is
important to include processes that facilitate
timely responses to alerts generated by the
solutions so that any detected attacks can be
mitigated. Such solutions may also be used to
automate mitigation, for example rate-limiting
controls, which can be implemented to mitigate
against brute-force attacks and enumeration

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Scripts loaded and executed in the payment page
can have their functionality altered without the
entity’s knowledge and can also have the
functionality to load additional external scripts (for
example, advertising and tracking, tag
management systems).
Such seemingly harmless scripts can be used by
potential attackers to upload malicious scripts that
can read and exfiltrate cardholder data from the
consumer browser.
Ensuring that the functionality of all such scripts is
understood to be necessary for the operation of
the payment page minimizes the number of
scripts that could be tampered with.
Ensuring that scripts have been explicitly
authorized reduces the probability of unnecessary
scripts being added to the payment page without
appropriate management approval.
Using techniques to prevent tampering with the
script will minimize the probability of the script
being modified to carry out unauthorized
behavior, such as skimming the cardholder data
from the payment page.
Good Practice
Scripts may be authorized by manual or
automated (e.g., workflow) processes.
Where the payment page will be loaded into an
inline frame (IFRAME), restricting the location that
the payment page can be loaded from, using the
parent page’s Content Security Policy (CSP) can
help prevent unauthorized content being
substituted for the payment page.
(continued on next page)
```
```
6.4.3 All payment page scripts that are loaded and
executed in the consumer’s browser are managed
as follows:
```
- A method is implemented to confirm that each
    script is authorized.
- A method is implemented to assure the integrity
    of each script.
- An inventory of all scripts is maintained with
    written justification as to why each is necessary.

```
6.4.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verify
that processes are defined for managing all
payment page scripts that are loaded and
executed in the consumer’s browser, in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
6.4.3.b Interview responsible personnel and
examine inventory records and system
configurations to verify that all payment page
scripts that are loaded and executed in the

Definitions
“Necessary” for this requirement means that the
entity’s review of each script justifies and confirms
why it is needed for the functionality of the
payment page to accept a payment transaction.
Examples
The integrity of scripts can be enforced by several
different mechanisms including, but not limited to:
```
- Sub-resource integrity (SRI), which allows the
    consumer browser to validate that a script has
    not been tampered with.
- A CSP, which limits the locations the
    consumer browser can load a script from and
    transmit account data to.
- Proprietary script or tag-management
    systems, which can prevent malicious script
    execution.

6.5 Changes to all system components are managed securely.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Change management procedures must be
applied to all changes—including the addition,
removal, or modification of any system
component—in the production environment. It is
important to document the reason for a change
and the change description so that relevant
parties understand and agree the change is
needed. Likewise, documenting the impacts of the
change allows all affected parties to plan
appropriately for any processing changes.
Good Practice
Approval by authorized parties confirms that the
change is legitimate and that the change is
sanctioned by the organization. Changes should
be approved by individuals with the appropriate
authority and knowledge to understand the impact
of the change.
Thorough testing by the entity confirms that the
security of the environment is not reduced by
implementing a change and that all existing
security controls either remain in place or are
replaced with equal or stronger security controls
after the change. The specific testing to be
performed will vary according to the type of
change and system component(s) affected.
For each change, it is important to have
documented procedures that address any failures
and provide instructions on how to return to a
secure state in case the change fails or adversely
affects the security of an application or system.
These procedures will allow the application or
system to be restored to its previous secure state.
```
```
6.5.1 Changes to all system components in the
production environment are made according to
established procedures that include:
```
- Reason for, and description of, the change.
- Documentation of security impact.
- Documented change approval by authorized
    parties.
- Testing to verify that the change does not
    adversely impact system security.
- For bespoke and custom software changes, all
    updates are tested for compliance with
    Requirement 6.2.4 before being deployed into
    production.
- Procedures to address failures and return to a
    secure state.

```
6.5.1.a Examine documented change control
procedures to verify procedures are defined for
changes to all system components in the
production environment to include all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
6.5.1.b Examine recent changes to system
components and trace those changes back to
related change control documentation. For each
change examined, verify the change is
implemented in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
All changes are tracked, authorized, and evaluated
for impact and security, and changes are managed
to avoid unintended effects to the security of system
components.

Having processes to analyze significant changes
helps ensure that all appropriate PCI DSS
controls are applied to any systems or networks
added or changed within the in-scope
environment, and that PCI DSS requirements
continue to be met to secure the environment.
Good Practice
Building this validation into change management
processes helps ensure that device inventories
and configuration standards are kept up to date
and security controls are applied where needed.
Examples
Applicable PCI DSS requirements that could be
impacted include, but are not limited to:
```
- Network and data-flow diagrams are updated
    to reflect changes.
- Systems are configured per configuration
    standards, with all default passwords changed
    and unnecessary services disabled.
- Systems are protected with required
    controls—for example, file integrity monitoring
    (FIM), anti-malware, patches, and audit
    logging.
- Sensitive authentication data is not stored, and
    all account data storage is documented and
    incorporated into data retention policy and
    procedures.
- New systems are included in the quarterly
    vulnerability scanning process.
- Systems are scanned for internal and external
    vulnerabilities after significant changes per
    Requirements 11.3.1.3 and 11.3.2.1.

```
6.5.2 Upon completion of a significant change, all
applicable PCI DSS requirements are confirmed to
be in place on all new or changed systems and
networks, and documentation is updated as
applicable.
```
```
6.5.2 Examine documentation for significant
changes, interview personnel, and observe the
affected systems/networks to verify that the entity
confirmed applicable PCI DSS requirements were
in place on all new or changed systems and
networks and that documentation was updated as
applicable.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
All system components are verified after a
significant change to be compliant with the
applicable PCI DSS requirements.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The goal of separating roles and functions
between production and pre-production
environments is to reduce the number of
personnel with access to the production
environment and account data and thereby
minimize risk of unauthorized, unintentional, or
inappropriate access to data and system
components and help ensure that access is
limited to those individuals with a business need
for such access.
The intent of this control is to separate critical
activities to provide oversight and review to catch
errors and minimize the chances of fraud or theft
(since two people would need to collude in order
to hide an activity).
Separating roles and functions, also referred to as
separation or segregation of duties, is a key
internal control concept to protect an entity’s
assets.

```
In environments with limited personnel where
individuals perform multiple roles or functions, this
same goal can be achieved with additional
procedural controls that provide accountability. For
example, a developer may also be an administrator
that uses an administrator-level account with
elevated privileges in the development environment
and, for their developer role, they use a separate
account with user-level access to the production
environment.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Use of live PANs outside of protected CDEs
provides malicious individuals with the opportunity
to gain unauthorized access to cardholder data.
Good Practice
Entities can minimize their storage of live PANs
by only storing them in pre-production when
strictly necessary for a specific and defined
testing purpose and securely deleting that data
after use.
If an entity requires PANs specifically designed
for test purposes, these can be obtained from
acquirers.
Definitions
Live PANs refer to valid PANs (not test PANs)
that have the potential to be used to conduct
payment transactions. Additionally, when
payment cards expire, the same PAN is often
reused with a different expiry date. All PANs must
be verified as being unable to conduct payment
transactions before they are excluded from PCI
DSS scope. It is the responsibility of the entity to
confirm that PANs are not live.
```
```
6.5.5 Live PANs are not used in pre-production
environments, except where those environments
are included in the CDE and protected in
accordance with all applicable PCI DSS

### Implement Strong Access Control Measures

**_Requirement 7: Restrict Access to System Components and Cardholder Data by Business Need to Know_**

```
Sections
```
```
7.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting access to system components and cardholder data by business need to know are defined and
understood.
7.2 Access to system components and data is appropriately defined and assigned.
7.3 Access to system components and data is managed via an access control system(s).
```
```
Overview
```
```
Unauthorized individuals may gain access to critical data or systems due to ineffective access control rules and definitions. To ensure critical
data can only be accessed by authorized personnel, systems and processes must be in place to limit access based on need to know and
according to job responsibilities.
```
```
“Access” or “access rights” are created by rules that provide users access to systems, applications, and data, while “privileges” allow a user to
perform a specific action or function in relation to that system, application, or data. For example, a user may have access rights to specific data,
but whether they can only read that data, or can also change or delete the data is determined by the user’s assigned privileges.
```
```
“Need to know” refers to providing access to only the least amount of data needed to perform a job.
```
```
“Least privileges” refers to providing only the minimum level of privileges needed to perform a job.
```
```
These requirements apply to user accounts and access for employees, contractors, consultants, and internal and external vendors and other
third parties (for example, for providing support or maintenance services). Certain requirements also apply to application and system accounts
used by the entity (also called “service accounts”).
```
```
These requirements do not apply to consumers (cardholders).
Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
7.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting access to system components and cardholder data by business need to know are defined and understood.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 7.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 7.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 7, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives.
```
```
7.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 7 are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```
7.1.1 Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that security policies and
operational procedures identified in Requirement 7
are managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting
activities within Requirement 7 are defined and
adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting
activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and
conform to management’s intent.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities, and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
7.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing
activities in Requirement 7 are documented,
assigned, and understood.
```
```
7.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that
descriptions of roles and responsibilities for
performing activities in Requirement 7 are
documented and assigned.
```
```
7.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility for
performing activities in Requirement 7 to verify that
roles and responsibilities are assigned as and are
understood.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the
activities in Requirement 7 are allocated. Personnel
are accountable for successful, continuous
operation of these requirements.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
7.2 Access to system components and data is appropriately defined and assigned.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Defining an access control model that is
appropriate for the entity’s technology and access
control philosophy supports a consistent and
uniform way of allocating access and reduces the
possibility of errors such as the granting of
excessive rights.
Good Practice
A factor to consider when defining access needs
is the separation of duties principle. This principle
is intended to prevent fraud and misuse or theft of
resources. For example, 1) dividing mission-
critical functions and information system support
functions among different individuals and/or
functions, 2) establishing roles such that
information system support activities are
performed by different functions/individuals (for
example, system management, programming,
configuration management, quality assurance and
testing, and network security), and 3) ensuring
security personnel administering access control
functions do not also administer audit functions.
In environments where one individual performs
multiple functions, such as administration and
security operations, duties may be assigned so
that no single individual has end-to-end control of
a process without an independent checkpoint. For
example, responsibility for configuration and
responsibility for approving changes could be
assigned to separate individuals.
(continued on next page)
```
```
7.2.1 An access control model is defined and
includes granting access as follows:
```
- Appropriate access depending on the entity’s
    business and access needs.
- Access to system components and data
    resources that is based on users’ job
    classification and functions.
- The least privileges required (for example, user,
    administrator) to perform a job function.

```
7.2.1.a Examine documented policies and
procedures and interview personnel to verify the
access control model is defined in accordance with
all elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
7.2.1.b Examine access control model settings and
verify that access needs are appropriately defined
in accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Access requirements are established according to
job functions following least-privilege and need-to-
know principles.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Definitions
Key elements of an access control model include:
```
- Resources to be protected (the
    systems/devices/data to which access is
    needed),
- Job functions that need access to the resource
    (for example, system administrator, call-center
    personnel, store clerk), and
- Which activities each job function needs to
    perform (for example, read/write or query).
Once job functions, resources, and activities per
job functions are defined, individuals can be
granted access accordingly.
**Examples**
Access control models that entities can consider
include role-based access control (RBAC) and
attribute-based access control (ABAC). The
access control model used by a given entity
depends on their business and access needs.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Assigning least privileges helps prevent users
without sufficient knowledge about the application
from incorrectly or accidentally changing
application configuration or altering its security
settings. Enforcing least privilege also helps to
minimize the scope of damage if an unauthorized
person gains access to a user ID.
Good Practice
Access rights are granted to a user by
assignment to one or several functions. Assess is
assigned depending on the specific user functions
and with the minimum scope required for the job.
When assigning privileged access, it is important
to assign individuals only the privileges they need
to perform their job (the “least privileges”). For
example, the database administrator or backup
administrator should not be assigned the same
privileges as the overall systems administrator.
Once needs are defined for user functions (per
PCI DSS requirement 7.2.1), it is easy to grant
individuals access according to their job
classification and function by using the already-
created roles.
Entities may wish to consider use of Privileged
Access Management (PAM), which is a method to
grant access to privileged accounts only when
those privileges are required, immediately
revoking that access once they are no longer
needed.
```
```
7.2.2 Access is assigned to users, including
privileged users, based on:
```
- Job classification and function.
- Least privileges necessary to perform job
    responsibilities.

```
7.2.2.a Examine policies and procedures to verify
they cover assigning access to users in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
7.2.2.b Examine user access settings, including for
privileged users, and interview responsible
management personnel to verify that privileges
assigned are in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
7.2.2.c Interview personnel responsible for
assigning access to verify that privileged user
access is assigned in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Access to systems and data is limited to only the
access needed to perform job functions, as defined
in the related access roles.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Documented approval (for example, in writing or
electronically) assures that those with access and
privileges are known and authorized by
management, and that their access is necessary
for their job function.
```
```
7.2.3 Required privileges are approved by
authorized personnel.
```
```
7.2.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verify
they define processes for approval of all privileges
by authorized personnel.
```
```
7.2.3.b Examine user IDs and assigned privileges,
and compare with documented approvals to verify
that:
```
- Documented approval exists for the assigned
    privileges.
- The approval was by authorized personnel.
- Specified privileges match the roles assigned to
    the individual.

```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Access privileges cannot be granted to users
without appropriate, documented authorization.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Regular review of access rights helps to detect
excessive access rights remaining after user job
responsibilities change, system functions change,
or other modifications. If excessive user rights are
not revoked in due time, they may be used by
malicious users for unauthorized access.
This review provides another opportunity to
ensure that accounts for all terminated users have
been removed (if any were missed at the time of
termination), as well as to ensure that any third
parties that no longer need access have had their
access terminated.
Good Practice
When a user transfers into a new role or a new
department, typically the privileges and access
associated with their former role are no longer
required. Continued access to privileges or
functions that are no longer required may
introduce the risk of misuse or errors. Therefore,
when responsibilities change, processes that
revalidate access help to ensure user access is
appropriate for the user’s new responsibilities.
Entities can consider implementing a regular,
repeatable process for conducting reviews of
access rights, and assigning “data owners” that
are responsible for managing and monitoring
access to data related to their job function and
that also ensure user access remains current and
appropriate. As an example, a direct manager
could review team access monthly, while the
senior manager reviews their groups’ access
quarterly, both making updates to access as
needed. The intent of these best practices is to
support and facilitate conducting the reviews at
least once every 6 months.
```
```
7.2.4 All user accounts and related access
privileges, including third-party/vendor accounts, are
reviewed as follows:
```
- At least once every six months.
- To ensure user accounts and access remain
    appropriate based on job function.
- Any inappropriate access is addressed.
- Management acknowledges that access remains
    appropriate.

```
7.2.4.a Examine policies and procedures to verify
they define processes to review all user accounts
and related access privileges, including third-
party/vendor accounts, in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.

7.2.4.b Interview responsible personnel and
examine documented results of periodic reviews of
user accounts to verify that all the results are in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Account privilege assignments are verified
periodically by management as correct, and
nonconformities are remediated.
```
```
Applicability Notes

```
This requirement applies to all user accounts and
related access privileges, including those used by
personnel and third parties/vendors, and accounts
used to access third-party cloud services.
See Requirements 7.2.5 and 7.2.5.1 and 8.6.1
through 8.6.3 for controls for application and system
accounts.
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
It is important to establish the appropriate access
level for application or system accounts. If such
accounts are compromised, malicious users will
receive the same access level as that granted to
the application or system. Therefore, it is
important to ensure limited access is granted to
system and application accounts on the same
basis as to user accounts.
Good Practice
Entities may want to consider establishing a
baseline when setting up these application and
system accounts including the following as
applicable to the organization:
```
- Making sure that the account is not a member
    of a privileged group such as domain
    administrators, local administrators, or root.
- Restricting which computers the account can
    be used on.
- Restricting hours of use.
- Removing any additional settings like VPN
    access and remote access.

```
7.2.5 All application and system accounts and
related access privileges are assigned and
managed as follows:
```
- Based on the least privileges necessary for the
    operability of the system or application.
- Access is limited to the systems, applications, or
    processes that specifically require their use.

```
7.2.5.a Examine policies and procedures to verify
they define processes to manage and assign
application and system accounts and related

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The misuse of query access to repositories of
cardholder data has been a regular cause of data
breaches. Limiting such access to administrators
reduces the risk of such access being abused by
unauthorized users.
Definitions
“Programmatic methods” means granting access
through means such as database stored
procedures that allow users to perform controlled
actions to data in a table, rather than via direct,
unfiltered access to the data repository by end
users (except for the responsible administrator(s),
who need direct access to the database for their
administrative duties).
Good Practice
Typical user actions include moving, copying, and
deleting data. Also consider the scope of privilege
needed when granting access. For example,
access can be granted to specific objects such as
data elements, files, tables, indexes, views, and
stored routines. Granting access to repositories of
cardholder data should follow the same process
as all other granted access, meaning that it is
based on roles, with only the privileges assigned
to each user that are needed to perform their job
functions.
```
```
7.2.6 All user access to query repositories of stored
cardholder data is restricted as follows:
```
- Via applications or other programmatic methods,
    with access and allowed actions based on user
    roles and least privileges.
- Only the responsible administrator(s) can directly
    access or query repositories of stored CHD.

```
7.2.6.a Examine policies and procedures and
interview personnel to verify processes are defined
for granting user access to query repositories of
stored cardholder data, in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.

7.2.6.b Examine configuration settings for querying
repositories of stored cardholder data to verify they
are in accordance with all elements specified in
this requirement.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Direct unfiltered (ad hoc) query access to
cardholder data repositories is prohibited, unless
performed by an authorized administrator.

This requirement applies to controls for user access
to query repositories of stored cardholder data.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without a mechanism to restrict access based on
user’s need to know, a user may unknowingly be
granted access to cardholder data. Access control
systems automate the process of restricting
access and assigning privileges.

7.3.1 An access control system(s) is in place that
restricts access based on a user’s need to know
and covers all system components.
```

```
```
Overview
```
```
Two fundamental principles of identifying and authenticating users are to 1) establish the identity of an individual or process on a computer
system, and 2) prove or verify the user associated with the identity is who the user claims to be.
```
```
Identification of an individual or process on a computer system is conducted by associating an identity with a person or process through an
identifier, such as a user, system, or application ID. These IDs (also referred to as “accounts”) fundamentally establish the identity of an
individual or process by assigning unique identification to each person or process to distinguish one user or process from another. When each
user or process can be uniquely identified, it ensures there is accountability for actions performed by that identity. When such accountability is in
place, actions taken can be traced to known and authorized users and processes.
```
```
The element used to prove or verify the identity is known as the authentication factor. Authentication factors are 1) something you know, such
as a password or passphrase, 2) something you have, such as a token device or smart card, or 3) something you are, such as a biometric
element.
```
```
The ID and the authentication factor together are considered authentication credentials and are used to gain access to the rights and privileges
associated with a user, application, system, or service accounts.
```
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
These requirements for identity and authentication are based on industry-accepted security principles and best practices to support the payment
ecosystem. NIST Special Publication 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines provides additional information on acceptable frameworks for digital
identity and authentication factors. It is important to note that the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines is intended for US Federal Agencies and
should be viewed in its entirety. Many of the concepts and approaches defined in these guidelines are expected to work with each other and
not as standalone parameters.
```
```
Note : Unless otherwise stated in the requirement, these requirements apply to all accounts on all system components , unless specifically
called out in an individual requirement, including but not limited to:
```
- _Point-of-sale accounts_
- _Accounts with administrative capabilities_
- _System and application accounts_
- _All accounts used to view or access cardholder data or to access systems with cardholder data.
This includes accounts used by employees, contractors, consultants, internal and external vendors, and other third parties (for example, for
providing support or maintenance services).
Certain requirements are not intended to apply to user accounts that have access to only one card number at a time to facilitate a single
transaction (such as IDs used by cashiers on point-of-sale terminals). When items do not apply, they are noted directly within the specific
requirement._
**These requirements do not apply to accounts used by consumers (cardholders).**

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
8.1 Processes and mechanisms for identifying users and authenticating access to system components are defined and understood.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 8.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 8.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 8, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives.
```
```
8.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 8 are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```
8.1.1 Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that security policies and
operational procedures that are identified in
Requirement 8 are managed in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting
activities within Requirement 8 are defined and
adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting
activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and
conform to management’s intent.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
8.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing
activities in Requirement 8 are documented,
assigned, and understood.
```
```
8.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that
descriptions of roles and responsibilities for
performing activities in Requirement 8 are
documented and assigned.
```
```
8.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility for
performing activities in Requirement 8 to verify that
roles and responsibilities are assigned as
Customized Approach Objective documented and are understood.^
```
```
Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the
activities in Requirement 8 are allocated. Personnel
are accountable for successful, continuous
operation of these requirements.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
8.2 User identification and related accounts for users and administrators are strictly managed throughout an account’s lifecycle.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The ability to trace actions performed on a
computer system to an individual establishes
accountability and traceability and is fundamental
to establishing effective access controls.
By ensuring each user is uniquely identified,
instead of using one ID for several employees, an
organization can maintain individual responsibility
for actions and an effective record in the audit log
per employee. In addition, this will assist with
issue resolution and containment when misuse or
malicious intent occurs.
```
```
8.2.1 All users are assigned a unique ID before
access to system components or cardholder data is
allowed.
```
```
8.2.1.a Interview responsible personnel to verify
that all users are assigned a unique ID for access
to system components and cardholder data.
```
```
8.2.1.b Examine audit logs and other evidence to
verify that access to system components and
cardholder data can be uniquely identified and
associated with individuals.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
All actions by all users are attributable to an
individual.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is not intended to apply to user
accounts within point-of-sale terminals that have
access to only one card number at a time to
facilitate a single transaction (such as IDs used by
cashiers on point-of-sale terminals).
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Group, shared, or generic (or default) accounts
are typically delivered with software or operating
systems—for example, root or with privileges
associated with a specific function, such as an
administrator.
If multiple users share the same authentication
credentials (for example, user account and
password), it becomes impossible to trace system
access and activities to an individual. In turn, this
prevents an entity from assigning accountability
for, or having effective logging of, an individual’s
actions since a given action could have been
performed by anyone in the group with knowledge
of the user ID and associated authentication
factors.
The ability to associate individuals to the actions
performed with an account is essential to provide
individual accountability and traceability regarding
who performed an action, what action was
performed, and when that action occurred.
Good Practice
If shared accounts are used for any reason,
strong management controls need to be
established to maintain individual accountability
and traceability.
(continued on next page)
```
```
8.2.2 Group, shared, or generic accounts, or other
shared authentication credentials are only used
when necessary on an exception basis, and are
managed as follows:
```
- Account use is prevented unless needed for an
    exceptional circumstance.
- Use is limited to the time needed for the
    exceptional circumstance.
- Business justification for use is documented.
- Use is explicitly approved by management.
- Individual user identity is confirmed before
    access to an account is granted.
- Every action taken is attributable to an individual
    user.

```
8.2.2.a Examine user account lists on system
components and applicable documentation to
verify that shared authentication credentials are
only used when necessary, on an exception basis,
and are managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
8.2.2.b Examine authentication policies and
procedures to verify processes are defined for
shared authentication credentials such that they
are only used when necessary, on an exception
basis, and are managed in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
8.2.2.c Interview system administrators to verify
that shared authentication credentials are only
used when necessary, on an exception basis, and
are managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
All actions performed by users with generic, system,
or shared IDs are attributable to an individual
person.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is not intended to apply to user
accounts within point-of-sale terminals that have
access to only one card number at a time to
facilitate a single transaction (such as IDs used by
cashiers on point-of-sale terminals).
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Examples
Tools and techniques can facilitate both
management and security of these types of
accounts and confirm individual user identity
before access to an account is granted. Entities
can consider password vaults or other system-
managed controls such as the sudo command.
An example of an exceptional circumstance is
where all other authentication methods have
failed, and a shared account is needed for
emergency use or “break the glass” administrator
access.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Service providers with remote access to customer
premises typically use this access to support POS
POI systems or provide other remote services.
If a service provider uses the same authentication
factors to access multiple customers, all the
service provider’s customers can easily be
compromised if an attacker compromises that one
factor.
Criminals know this and deliberately target
service providers looking for a shared
authentication factor that gives them remote
access to many merchants via that single factor.
Examples
Technologies such as multi-factor mechanisms
that provide a unique credential for each
connection (such as a single-use password) could
also meet the intent of this requirement.
```
```
8.2.3 Additional requirement for service
providers only: Service providers with remote
access to customer premises use unique
authentication factors for each customer premises.
```
```
8.2.3 Additional testing procedure for service
provider assessments only: Examine
authentication policies and procedures and
interview personnel to verify that service providers
with remote access to customer premises use
unique authentication factors for remote access to
each customer premises.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
A service provider’s credential used for one
customer cannot be used for any other customer.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement applies only when the entity being
assessed is a service provider.
This requirement is not intended to apply to service
providers accessing their own shared services
environments, where multiple customer
environments are hosted.
If service provider employees use shared
authentication factors to remotely access customer
premises, these factors must be unique per
customer and managed in accordance with
Requirement 8.2.2.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
It is imperative that the lifecycle of a user ID
(additions, deletions, and modifications) is
controlled so that only authorized accounts can
perform functions, actions are auditable, and
privileges are limited to only what is required.
Attackers often compromise an existing account
and then escalate the privileges of that account to
perform unauthorized acts, or they may create
new IDs to continue their activity in the
background. It is essential to detect and respond
when user accounts are created or changed
outside the normal change process or without
corresponding authorization.
```
```
8.2.4 Addition, deletion, and modification of user
IDs, authentication factors, and other identifier
objects are managed as follows:
```
- Authorized with the appropriate approval.
- Implemented with only the privileges specified
    on the documented approval.

```
8.2.4 Examine documented authorizations across
various phases of the account lifecycle (additions,
modifications, and deletions) and examine system
settings to verify the activity has been managed in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Lifecycle events for user IDs and authentication
factors cannot occur without appropriate
authorization.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement applies to all user accounts,
including employees, contractors, consultants,
temporary workers, and third-party vendors.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If an employee or third party/vendor has left the
company and still has access to the network via
their user account, unnecessary or malicious
access to cardholder data could occur—either by
the former employee or by a malicious user who
exploits the old and/or unused account.
```
```
8.2.5 Access for terminated users is immediately
revoked.
```
```
8.2.5.a Examine information sources for terminated
users and review current user access lists—for
both local and remote access—to verify that
terminated user IDs have been deactivated or
removed from the access lists.
```
```
8.2.5.b Interview responsible personnel to verify
that all physical authentication factors—such as,
smart cards, tokens, etc.—have been returned or
deactivated for terminated users.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The accounts of terminated users cannot be used.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Accounts that are not used regularly are often
targets of attack since it is less likely that any
changes, such as a changed password, will be
noticed. As such, these accounts may be more
easily exploited and used to access cardholder
data.
Good Practice
Where it may be reasonably anticipated that an
account will not be used for an extended period of
time, such as an extended leave of absence, the
account should be disabled as soon as the leave
begins, rather than waiting 90 days.
```
```
8.2.6 Inactive user accounts are removed or
disabled within 90 days of inactivity.
```
```
8.2.6 Examine user accounts and last logon
information, and interview personnel to verify that
any inactive user accounts are removed or
disabled within 90 days of inactivity.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Inactive user accounts cannot be used.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Allowing third parties to have 24/7 access into an
entity’s systems and networks in case they need
to provide support increases the chances of
unauthorized access. This access could result in
an unauthorized user in the third party’s
environment or a malicious individual using the
always-available external entry point into an
entity’s network. Where third parties do need
access 24/7, it should be documented, justified,
monitored, and tied to specific service reasons.
Good Practice
Enabling access only for the time periods needed
and disabling it as soon as it is no longer required
helps prevent misuse of these connections.
Additionally, consider assigning third parties a
start and stop date for their access in accordance
with their service contract.
Monitoring third-party access helps ensure that
third parties are accessing only the systems
necessary and only during approved time frames.
Any unusual activity using third-party accounts
should be followed up and resolved.
```
```
8.2.7 Accounts used by third parties to access,
support, or maintain system components via remote
access are managed as follows:
```
- Enabled only during the time period needed and
    disabled when not in use.
- Use is monitored for unexpected activity.

```
8.2.7 Interview personnel, examine documentation
for managing accounts, and examine evidence to
verify that accounts used by third parties for
remote access are managed according to all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Third party remote access cannot be used except
where specifically authorized and use is overseen
by management.
```

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
When users walk away from an open machine
with access to system components or cardholder
data, there is a risk that the machine may be used
by others in the user’s absence, resulting in
unauthorized account access and/or misuse.
Good Practice
The re-authentication can be applied either at the
system level to protect all sessions running on
that machine or at the application level.
Entities may also want to consider staging
controls in succession to further restrict the
access of an unattended session as time passes.
For example, the screensaver may activate after
15 minutes and log off the user after an hour.
However, timeout controls must balance the risk
of access and exposure with the impact to the
user and purpose of the access.
If a user needs to run a program from an
unattended computer, the user can log in to the
computer to initiate the program, and then “lock”
the computer so that no one else can use the
user’s login while the computer is unattended.
Examples
One way to meet this requirement is to configure
an automated screensaver to launch whenever
the console is idle for 15 minutes and requiring
the logged-in user to enter their password to
unlock the screen.
```
```
8.2.8 If a user session has been idle for more than
15 minutes, the user is required to re-authenticate to
re-activate the terminal or session.
```
```
8.2.8 Examine system configuration settings to
verify that system/session idle timeout features for
user sessions have been set to 15 minutes or less.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
A user session cannot be used except by the
authorized user.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```

This requirement is not intended to apply to user
accounts on point-of-sale terminals that have
access to only one card number at a time to
facilitate a single transaction (such as IDs used by
cashiers on point-of-sale terminals).
This requirement is not meant to prevent legitimate
activities from being performed while the

8.3 Strong authentication for users and administrators is established and managed.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
When used in addition to unique IDs, an
authentication factor helps protect user IDs from
being compromised, since the attacker needs to
have the unique ID and compromise the
associated authentication factor(s).
Good Practice
A common approach for a malicious individual to
compromise a system is to exploit weak or
nonexistent authentication factors (for example,
passwords/passphrases). Requiring strong
authentication factors helps protect against this
attack.
Further Information
See fidoalliance.org for more information about
using tokens, smart cards, or biometrics as
authentication factors.
```
```
8.3.1 All user access to system components for
users and administrators is authenticated via at
least one of the following authentication factors:
```
- Something you know, such as a password or
    passphrase.
- Something you have, such as a token device or
    smart card.
- Something you are, such as a biometric element.

```
8.3.1.a Examine documentation describing the
authentication factor(s) used to verify that user
access to system components is authenticated via
at least one authentication factor specified in this
requirement.
```
```
8.3.1.b For each type of authentication factor used
with each type of system component, observe an
authentication to verify that authentication is
functioning consistently with documented
authentication factor(s).
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
An account cannot be accessed except with a
combination of user identity and an authentication
factor.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is not intended to apply to user
accounts on point-of-sale terminals that have
access to only one card number at a time to
facilitate a single transaction (such as IDs used by
cashiers on point-of-sale terminals).
This requirement does not supersede multi-factor
authentication (MFA) requirements but applies to
those in-scope systems not otherwise subject to
MFA requirements.
A digital certificate is a valid option for “something
you have” if it is unique for a particular user.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Network devices and applications have been
known to transmit unencrypted, readable
authentication factors (such as passwords and
passphrases) across the network and/or store
these values without encryption. As a result, a
malicious individual can easily intercept this
information during transmission using a “sniffer,”
or directly access unencrypted authentication
factors in files where they are stored, and then
use this data to gain unauthorized access.
```
```
8.3.2 Strong cryptography is used to render all
authentication factors unreadable during
transmission and storage on all system
components.
```
```
8.3.2.a Examine vendor documentation and

```
8.3.2.b Examine repositories of authentication
factors to verify that they are unreadable during
storage.

Cleartext authentication factors cannot be obtained,
derived, or reused from the interception of
communications or from stored data.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Malicious individuals use "social engineering”
techniques to impersonate a user of a system —
for example, calling a help desk and acting as a
legitimate user—to have an authentication factor
changed so they can use a valid user ID.
Requiring positive identification of a user reduces
the probability of this type of attack succeeding.
Good Practice
Modifications to authentication factors for which
user identity should be verified include but are not
limited to performing password resets,
provisioning new hardware or software tokens,
and generating new keys.
Examples
Methods to verify a user’s identity include a secret
question/answer, knowledge-based information,
and calling the user back at a known and
previously established phone number.
```
```
8.3.3 User identity is verified before modifying any
authentication factor.
```
```
8.3.3 Examine procedures for modifying
authentication factors and observe security
personnel to verify that when a user requests a
modification of an authentication factor, the user’s
identity is verified before the authentication factor
```
**Customized Approach Objective** (^) is modified.
Unauthorized individuals cannot gain system access
by impersonating the identity of an authorized user.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without account-lockout mechanisms in place, an
attacker can continually try to guess a password
through manual or automated tools (for example,
password cracking) until the attacker succeeds
and gains access to a user’s account.
If an account is locked out due to someone
continually trying to guess a password, controls to
delay reactivation of the locked account stop the
malicious individual from guessing the password,
as they will have to stop for a minimum of 30
minutes until the account is reactivated.
Good Practice
Before reactivating a locked account, the user’s
identity should be confirmed. For example, the
administrator or help desk personnel can validate
that the actual account owner is requesting
reactivation, or there may be password reset self-
service mechanisms that the account owner uses
to verify their identity.
```
```
8.3.4 Invalid authentication attempts are limited by:
```
- Locking out the user ID after not more than 10
    attempts.
- Setting the lockout duration to a minimum of 30
    minutes or until the user’s identity is confirmed.

```
8.3.4.a Examine system configuration settings to
verify that authentication parameters are set to
require that user accounts be locked out after not
more than 10 invalid logon attempts.
```
```
8.3.4.b Examine system configuration settings to
verify that password parameters are set to require
that once a user account is locked out, it remains
locked for a minimum of 30 minutes or until the
user’s identity is confirmed.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
An authentication factor cannot be guessed in a
brute force, online attack.

```
```
8.3.5 If passwords/passphrases are used as
authentication factors to meet Requirement 8.3.1,
they are set and reset for each user as follows:
```
- Set to a unique value for first-time use and upon
    reset.
- Forced to be changed immediately after the first
    use.

```
8.3.5 Examine procedures for setting and resetting
passwords/passphrases (if used as authentication
factors to meet Requirement 8.3.1) and observe
security personnel to verify that
passwords/passphrases are set and reset in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.

Customized Approach Objective
```
```
An initial or reset password/passphrase assigned to
a user cannot be used by an unauthorized user.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Strong passwords/passphrases may be the first
line of defense into a network since a malicious
individual will often first try to find accounts with
weak, static, or non-existent passwords. If
passwords are short or easily guessable, it is
relatively easy for a malicious individual to find
these weak accounts and compromise a network
under the guise of a valid user ID.
Good Practice
Password/passphrase strength is dependent on
password/passphrase complexity, length, and
randomness. Passwords/passphrases should be
sufficiently complex, so they are impractical for an
attacker to guess or otherwise discover its value.
Entities can consider adding increased complexity
by requiring the use of special characters and
upper- and lower-case characters, in addition to
the minimum standards outlined by this
requirement. Additional complexity increases the
time required for offline brute force attacks of
hashed passwords/passphrases.
Another option for increasing the resistance of
passwords to guessing attacks is by comparing
proposed password/passphrases to a bad

8.3.6 If passwords/passphrases are used as
authentication factors to meet Requirement 8.3.1,
they meet the following minimum level of
complexity:
```
- A minimum length of 12 characters (or IF the
    system does not support 12 characters, a
    minimum length of eight characters).
- Contain both numeric and alphabetic characters.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If password history is not maintained, the
effectiveness of changing passwords is reduced,
as previous passwords can be reused over and
over. Requiring that passwords cannot be reused
for a period reduces the likelihood that passwords
that have been guessed or brute-forced will be re-
used in the future.
Passwords or passphrases may have previously
been changed due to suspicion of compromise or
because the password or passphrase exceeded
its effective use period, both of which are reasons
why previously used passwords should not be
reused.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Communicating authentication policies and
procedures to all users helps them to understand
and abide by the policies.
Good Practice
Guidance on selecting strong passwords may
include suggestions to help personnel select
hard-to-guess passwords that do not contain
dictionary words or information about the user,
such as the user ID, names of family members,
date of birth, etc.
Guidance for protecting authentication factors
may include not writing down passwords or not
saving them in insecure files, and being alert to
malicious individuals who may try to exploit their
passwords (for example, by calling an employee
and asking for their password so the caller can
“troubleshoot a problem”).
Alternatively, entities can implement processes to
confirm passwords meet password policy, for
example, by comparing password choices to a list
of unacceptable passwords and having users
choose a new password for any that match with
one on the list. Instructing users to change
passwords if there is a chance the password is no
longer secure can prevent malicious users from
using a legitimate password to gain unauthorized
access.
```
```
8.3.8 Authentication policies and procedures are
documented and communicated to all users
including:
```
- Guidance on selecting strong authentication
    factors.
- Guidance for how users should protect their
    authentication factors.
- Instructions not to reuse previously used
    passwords/passphrases.
- Instructions to change passwords/passphrases if
    there is any suspicion or knowledge that the
    password/passphrases have been compromised
    and how to report the incident.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Access to in-scope system components that are
not in the CDE may be provided using a single
authentication factor, such as a
password/passphrase, token device or smart
card, or biometric attribute. Where
passwords/passphrases are employed as the only
authentication factor for such access, additional
controls are required to protect the integrity of the
password/passphrase.
Good Practice
Passwords/passphrases that are valid for a long
time without a change provide malicious
individuals with more time to break the
password/phrase. Periodically changing
passwords offers less time for a malicious
individual to crack a password/passphrase and
less time to use a compromised password.
Using a password/passphrase as the only
authentication factor provides a single point of
failure if compromised. Therefore, in these
implementations, controls are needed to minimize
how long malicious activity could occur via a
compromised password/passphrase.
Dynamically analyzing an account’s security
posture is another option that allows for more
rapid detection and response to address
potentially compromised credentials. Such
analysis takes a number of data points, which
may include device integrity, location, access
times, and the resources accessed to determine
in real time whether an account can be granted
access to a requested resource. In this way,
access can be denied and accounts blocked if it is
suspected that authentication credentials have
been compromised.

- User accounts on point-of-sale terminals that
    have access to only one card number at a time
    to facilitate a single transaction (such as IDs
    used by cashiers on point-of-sale terminals).
MFA is required for both types of access specified in
Requirements 8.4.2 and 8.4.3. Therefore, applying
MFA to one type of access does not replace the
need to apply another instance of MFA to the other
type of access. If an individual first connects to the
entity’s network via remote access, and then later
initiates a connection into the CDE from within the
network, per this requirement the individual would
authenticate using MFA twice, once when
connecting via remote access to the entity’s network
and once when connecting via non-console
administrative access from the entity’s network into
the CDE.
_(continued on next page)_


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

on-premises applications, network security devices,
workstations, servers, and endpoints, and includes
access directly to an entity’s networks or systems as
well as web-based access to an application or

MFA for remote access into the CDE can be
implemented at the network or system/application
level; it does not have to be applied at both levels.
For example, if MFA is used when a user connects
to the CDE network, it does not have to be used
when the user logs into each system or application

The requirement for MFA for remote access
originating from outside the entity’s network applies
to all user accounts that can access the network
remotely, where that remote access leads to or
could lead to access into the CDE.
If remote access is to a part of the entity’s network
that is properly segmented from the CDE, such that
remote users cannot access or impact the CDE,
MFA for remote access to that part of the network is
not required. However, MFA is required for any
remote access to networks with access to the CDE
and is recommended for all remote access to the
entity’s networks.

8.6 Use of application and system accounts and associated authentication factors is strictly managed.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Like individual user accounts, system and
application accounts require accountability and
strict management to ensure they are used only
for the intended purpose and are not misused.
Attackers often compromise system or application
accounts to gain access to cardholder data.
Good Practice
Where possible, configure system and application
accounts to disallow interactive login to prevent
unauthorized individuals from logging in and using
the account with its associated system privileges,
and to limit the machines and devices on which
the account can be used.
Definitions
System or application accounts are those
accounts that execute processes or perform tasks
on a computer system or application and are not
typically accounts that an individual logs into.
These accounts usually have elevated privileges
that are required to perform specialized tasks or
functions.
Interactive login is the ability for a person to log
into a system or application account in the same
manner as a normal user account. Using system
and application accounts this way means there is
no accountability and traceability of actions taken
by the user.
```
```
8.6.1 If accounts used by systems or applications
can be used for interactive login, they are managed
as follows:
```
- Interactive use is prevented unless needed for
    an exceptional circumstance.
- Interactive use is limited to the time needed for
    the exceptional circumstance.
- Business justification for interactive use is
    documented.
- Interactive use is explicitly approved by
    management.
- Individual user identity is confirmed before
    access to account is granted.
- Every action taken is attributable to an individual
    user.

```
8.6.1 Examine application and system accounts
that can be used interactively and interview
administrative personnel to verify that application
and system accounts are managed in accordance
with all elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective

When used interactively, all actions with accounts
designated as system or application accounts are
authorized and attributable to an individual person.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Not properly protecting passwords/passphrases
used by application and system accounts,
especially if those accounts can be used for
interactive login, increases the risk and success
of unauthorized use of those privileged accounts.
Good Practice
Changing these values due to suspected or
confirmed disclosure can be particularly difficult to
implement.
Tools can facilitate both management and
security of authentication factors for application
and system accounts. For example, consider
password vaults or other system-managed
controls.
```
```
8.6.2 Passwords/passphrases for any application
and system accounts that can be used for
interactive login are not hard coded in scripts,
configuration/property files, or bespoke and custom
source code.
```

8.6.2.a Interview personnel and examine system
development procedures to verify that processes
are defined for application and system accounts
that can be used for interactive login, specifying
that passwords/passphrases are not hard coded in
scripts, configuration/property files, or bespoke and
custom source code.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Systems and application accounts pose more
inherent security risk than user accounts because
they often run in an elevated security context, with
access to systems that may not be typically
granted to user accounts, such as programmatic
access to databases, etc. As a result, special
consideration must be made to protect
passwords/passphrases used for application and
system accounts.
Good Practice
Entities should consider the following risk factors
when determining how to protect application and
system passwords/passphrases against misuse:
```
- How securely the passwords/passphrases
    are stored (for example, whether they are
    stored in a password vault).
- Staff turnover.
- The number of people with access to the
    authentication factor.
- Whether the account can be used for
    interactive login.
- Whether the security posture of accounts is
    dynamically analyzed, and real-time access
    to resources is automatically determined
    accordingly (see Requirement 8.3.9).
All these elements affect the level of risk for
application and system accounts and might
impact the security of systems accessed by the
system and application accounts.
_(continued on next page)_

```
8.6.3 Passwords/passphrases for any application
and system accounts are protected against misuse
as follows:
```
- Passwords/passphrases are changed
    periodically (at the frequency defined in the
    entity’s targeted risk analysis, which is performed
    according to all elements specified in
    Requirement 12.3.1) and upon suspicion or
    confirmation of compromise.
- Passwords/passphrases are constructed with
    sufficient complexity appropriate for how
    frequently the entity changes the
    passwords/passphrases.

```
8.6.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verify
that procedures are defined to protect
passwords/passphrases for application or system
accounts against misuse in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
8.6.3.b Examine the entity’s targeted risk analysis
for the change frequency and complexity for
passwords/passphrases used for interactive login
to application and system accounts to verify the
risk analysis was performed in accordance with all
elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1 and
addresses:
```
- The frequency defined for periodic changes to
    application and system
    passwords/passphrases.
- The complexity defined for
    passwords/passphrases and appropriateness of
    the complexity relative to the frequency of
    changes.

```
Customized Approach Objective 8.6.3.c^ Interview responsible personnel and
examine system configuration settings to verify that
passwords/passphrases for any application and
system accounts that can be used for interactive
login are protected against misuse in accordance
with all elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
Passwords/passphrases used by application and
system accounts cannot be used indefinitely and
are structured to resist brute-force and guessing
attacks.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Entities should correlate their selected change
frequency for application and system
passwords/passwords with their selected
complexity for those passwords/passphrases –
i.e., the complexity should be more rigorous when
passwords/passphrases are changed infrequently
and can be less rigorous when changed more
frequently. For example, a longer change
frequency is more justifiable when
passwords/passphrases complexity is set to 36
alphanumeric characters with upper- and lower-
case letters, numbers, and special characters.
Best practices are to consider password changes
at least once a year, a password/passphrase
length of at least 15 characters, and complexity
for the passwords/passphrase of alphanumeric
characters, with upper- and lower-case letters,
and special characters.
Further Information
For information about variability and equivalency
of password strength for passwords/passphrases
of different formats, see the industry standards
(for example, the current version of NIST SP 800-
63 Digital Identity Guidelines ).

**_Requirement 9: Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data_**

```
Sections
```
```
9.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting physical access to cardholder data are defined and understood.
9.2 Physical access controls manage entry into facilities and systems containing cardholder data.
9.3 Physical access for personnel and visitors is authorized and managed.
9.4 Media with cardholder data is securely stored, accessed, distributed, and destroyed.
9.5 Point of interaction (POI) devices are protected from tampering and unauthorized substitution.
```
```
Overview
```
```
Any physical access to cardholder data or systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data provides the opportunity for individuals to
access and/or remove systems or hardcopies containing cardholder data; therefore, physical access should be appropriately restricted.
```
```
There are three different areas mentioned in Requirement 9:
```
1. Requirements that specifically refer to sensitive areas are intended to apply to those areas only.
2. Requirements that specifically refer to the cardholder data environment (CDE) are intended to apply to the entire CDE, including any
    sensitive areas residing within the CDE.
3. Requirements that specifically refer to the facility are referencing the types of controls that may be managed more broadly at the
    physical boundary of a business premise (such as a building) within which CDEs and sensitive areas reside. These controls often exist
    outside a CDE or sensitive area, for example a guard desk that identifies, badges, and logs visitors. The term “facility” is used to
    recognize that these controls may exist at different places within a facility, for instance, at building entry or at an internal entrance to a
    data center or office space.
Refer to _Appendix G_ for definitions of “media,” “personnel,” “sensitive areas” and other PCI DSS terms.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
9.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting physical access to cardholder data are defined and understood.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 9.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 9.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 9, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives.
Policies and procedures, including updates, are
actively communicated to all affected personnel,
and are supported by operating procedures
describing how to perform activities.
```
```
9.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 9 are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```
9.1.1 Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that security policies and
operational procedures identified in Requirement 9
are managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting
activities within Requirement 9 are defined and
adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting
activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and
conform to management’s intent.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities, and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
9.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing
activities in Requirement 9 are documented,
assigned, and understood.
```
```
9.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that
descriptions of roles and responsibilities for
performing activities in Requirement 9 are

9.2 Physical access controls manage entry into facilities and systems containing cardholder data.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without physical access controls, unauthorized
persons could potentially gain access to the CDE
and sensitive information, or could alter system
configurations, introduce vulnerabilities into the
network, or destroy or steal equipment. Therefore,
the purpose of this requirement is that physical
access to the CDE is controlled via physical
security controls such as badge readers or other
mechanisms such as lock and key.
Good Practice
Whichever mechanism meets this requirement, it
must be sufficient for the organization to verify
that only authorized personnel are granted
access.
Examples
Facility entry controls include physical security
controls at each computer room, data center, and
other physical areas with systems in the CDE. It
can also include badge readers or other devices
that manage physical access controls, such as
lock and key with a current list of all individuals
holding the keys.
```
```
9.2.1 Appropriate facility entry controls are in place
to restrict physical access to systems in the CDE.
```
```
9.2.1 Observe entry controls and interview
responsible personnel to verify that physical
security controls are in place to restrict access to
systems in the CDE.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
System components in the CDE cannot be
physically accessed by unauthorized personnel.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Maintaining details of individuals entering and
exiting the sensitive areas can help with
investigations of physical breaches by identifying
individuals that physically accessed the sensitive
areas, as well as when they entered and exited.
Good Practice
Whichever mechanism meets this requirement, it
should effectively monitor all entry and exit points
to sensitive areas.
Criminals attempting to gain physical access to
sensitive areas will often try to disable or bypass
the monitoring controls. To protect these controls
from tampering, video cameras could be
positioned so they are out of reach and/or be
monitored to detect tampering. Similarly, physical
access control mechanisms could be monitored
or have physical protections installed to prevent
them from being damaged or disabled by
malicious individuals.
```
```
9.2.1.1 Individual physical access to sensitive areas
within the CDE is monitored with either video
cameras or physical access control mechanisms (or
both) as follows:
```
- Entry and exit points to/from sensitive areas
    within the CDE are monitored.
- Monitoring devices or mechanisms are protected
    from tampering or disabling.
- Collected data is reviewed and correlated with
    other entries.
- Collected data is stored for at least three
    months, unless otherwise restricted by law.

```
9.2.1.1.a Observe locations where individual
physical access to sensitive areas within the CDE
occurs to verify that either video cameras or
physical access control mechanisms (or both) are
in place to monitor the entry and exit points.
```
```
9.2.1.1.b Observe locations where individual
physical access to sensitive areas within the CDE
occurs to verify that either video cameras or
physical access control mechanisms (or both) are
protected from tampering or disabling.
```
```
9.2.1.1.c Observe the physical access control
mechanisms and/or examine video cameras and
interview responsible personnel to verify that:
```
- Collected data from video cameras and/or
    physical access control mechanisms is
    reviewed and correlated with other entries.
- Collected data is stored for at least three
    months.

```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Trusted, verifiable records are maintained of
individual physical entry to, and exit from, sensitive
areas.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Restricting access to network jacks (or network
ports) will prevent malicious individuals from
plugging into readily available network jacks and
gaining access to the CDE or systems connected
to the CDE.
Good Practice
Whether logical or physical controls, or a
combination of both, are used, they should
prevent an individual or device that is not explicitly
authorized from being able to connect to the
network.
Examples
Methods to meet this requirement include network
jacks located in public areas and areas accessible
to visitors could be disabled and only enabled
when network access is explicitly authorized.
Alternatively, processes could be implemented to
ensure that visitors are escorted at all times in
areas with active network jacks.
```
```
9.2.2 Physical and/or logical controls are
implemented to restrict use of publicly accessible
network jacks within the facility.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without appropriate physical security over access
to wireless components and devices, and
computer networking and telecommunications
equipment and lines, malicious users could gain
access to the entity’s network resources.
Additionally, they could connect their own devices
to the network to gain unauthorized access to the
CDE or systems connected to the CDE.
Additionally, securing networking and
communications hardware prevents malicious
users from intercepting network traffic or
physically connecting their own devices to wired
network resources.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Establishing procedures for granting, managing,
and removing access when it is no longer needed
ensures non-authorized individuals are prevented
from gaining access to areas containing
cardholder data. In addition, it is important to limit
access to the actual badging system and badging
materials to prevent unauthorized personnel from
making their own badges and/or setting up their
own access rules.
Good Practice
It is important to visually identify the personnel
that are physically present, and whether the
individual is a visitor or an employee.
Examples
One way to identify personnel is to assign them
badges.
```
```
9.3.1 Procedures are implemented for authorizing
and managing physical access of personnel to the
CDE, including:
```
- Identifying personnel.
- Managing changes to an individual’s physical
    access requirements.
- Revoking or terminating personnel identification.
- Limiting access to the identification process or

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Controlling physical access to sensitive areas
helps ensure that only authorized personnel with
a legitimate business need are granted access.
Good Practice
Where possible, organizations should have
policies and procedures to ensure that before
personnel leaving the organization, all physical
access mechanisms are returned, or disabled as
soon as possible upon their departure. This will
ensure personnel cannot gain physical access to
sensitive areas once their employment has
ended.
```
```
9.3.1.1 Physical access to sensitive areas within the
CDE for personnel is controlled as follows:
```
- Access is authorized and based on individual job
    function.
- Access is revoked immediately upon termination.
- All physical access mechanisms, such as keys,
    access cards, etc., are returned or disabled upon
    termination.

```
9.3.1.1.a Observe personnel in sensitive areas
within the CDE, interview responsible personnel,
and examine physical access control lists to verify
that:

If steps are not taken to destroy information
contained on hard-copy media before disposal,
malicious individuals may retrieve information
from the disposed media, leading to a data
compromise. For example, malicious individuals
may use a technique known as “dumpster diving,”
where they search through trashcans and recycle
bins looking for hard-copy materials with
information they can use to launch an attack.
Securing storage containers used for materials
that are going to be destroyed prevents sensitive
information from being captured while the
materials are being collected.
Good Practice
Consider “to-be-shredded” containers with a lock
that prevents access to its contents or that
physically prevent access to the inside of the
container.

9.5 Point-of-interaction (POI) devices are protected from tampering and unauthorized substitution.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Criminals attempt to steal payment card data by
stealing and/or manipulating card-reading devices
and terminals. Criminals will try to steal devices
so they can learn how to break into them, and
they often try to replace legitimate devices with
fraudulent devices that send them payment card
data every time a card is entered.
They will also try to add “skimming” components
to the outside of devices, which are designed to
capture payment card data before it enters the
device—for example, by attaching an additional
card reader on top of the legitimate card reader
so that the payment card data is captured twice:
once by the criminal’s component and then by the
device’s legitimate component. In this way,
transactions may still be completed without
interruption while the criminal is “skimming” the
payment card data during the process.
Further Information
Additional best practices on skimming prevention
are available on the PCI SSC website.
```
```
9.5.1 POI devices that capture payment card data
via direct physical interaction with the payment card
form factor are protected from tampering and
unauthorized substitution, including the following:
```
- Maintaining a list of POI devices.
- Periodically inspecting POI devices to look for
    tampering or unauthorized substitution.
- Training personnel to be aware of suspicious
    behavior and to report tampering or
    unauthorized substitution of devices.

```
9.5.1 Examine documented policies and
procedures to verify that processes are defined
that include all elements specified in this
requirement.
```

```
These requirements apply to deployed POI devices
used in card-present transactions (that is, a
payment card form factor such as a card that is
swiped, tapped, or dipped). This requirement is not
intended to apply to manual PAN key-entry
components such as computer keyboards.
This requirement is recommended, but not required,
for manual PAN key-entry components such as

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Keeping an up-to-date list of POI devices helps
an organization track where devices are
supposed to be and quickly identify if a device is
missing or lost.
Good Practice
The method for maintaining a list of devices may
be automated (for example, a device-
management system) or manual (for example,
documented in electronic or paper records). For
on-the-road devices, the location may include the
name of the personnel to whom the device is
assigned.
Examples
Methods to maintain device locations include
identifying the address of the site or facility where
the device is located.
```
```
9.5.1.1 An up-to-date list of POI devices is
maintained, including:
```
- Make and model of the device.
- Location of device.
- Device serial number or other methods of unique
    identification.

```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Regular inspections of devices will help
organizations detect tampering more quickly via
external evidence—for example, the addition of a
card skimmer—or replacement of a device,
thereby minimizing the potential impact of using
fraudulent devices.
Good Practice
Methods for periodic inspection include checking
the serial number or other device characteristics
and comparing the information to the list of POI
devices to verify the device has not been
swapped with a fraudulent device.
Examples
The type of inspection will depend on the device.
For instance, photographs of devices known to be
secure can be used to compare a device’s current
appearance with its original appearance to see
whether it has changed. Another option may be to
use a secure marker pen, such as a UV light
marker, to mark device surfaces and device
openings so any tampering or replacement will be
apparent. Criminals will often replace the outer
casing of a device to hide their tampering, and
these methods may help to detect such activities.
Device vendors may also provide security
guidance and “how to” guides to help determine
whether the device has been subject to
tampering.
Signs that a device might have been tampered
with or substituted include:
```
- Unexpected attachments or cables plugged
    into the device.
- Missing or changed security labels.
- Broken or differently colored casing.
- Changes to the serial number or other
    external markings.

```
9.5.1.2 POI device surfaces are periodically
inspected to detect tampering and unauthorized
substitution.
```
```
9.5.1.2.a Examine documented procedures to
verify processes are defined for periodic
inspections of POI device surfaces to detect
tampering and unauthorized substitution.
```
```
9.5.1.2.b Interview responsible personnel and
observe inspection processes to verify:
```
- Personnel are aware of procedures for
    inspecting devices.
- All devices are periodically inspected for
    evidence of tampering and unauthorized
    substitution.

```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Point of Interaction Devices cannot be tampered
with, substituted without authorization, or have
skimming attachments installed without timely
detection.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Entities are best placed to determine the
frequency of POI device inspections based on the
environment in which the device operates.
Good Practice
The frequency of inspections will depend on
factors such as the location of a device and
whether the device is attended or unattended. For
example, devices left in public areas without
supervision by the organization’s personnel might
have more frequent inspections than devices kept
in secure areas or supervised when accessible to
the public. In addition, many POI vendors include
guidance in their user documentation about how
often POI devices should be checked, and for
what – entities should consult their vendors’
documentation and incorporate those
recommendations into their periodic inspections.
```
```
9.5.1.2.1 The frequency of periodic POI device
inspections and the type of inspections performed is
defined in the entity’s targeted risk analysis, which is
performed according to all elements specified in
Requirement 12.3.1.
```
```
9.5.1.2.1.a Examine the entity’s targeted risk
analysis for the frequency of periodic POI device
inspections and type of inspections performed to
verify the risk analysis was performed in
accordance with all elements specified in

```
```
9.5.1.2.1.b Examine documented results of
periodic device inspections and interview
personnel to verify that the frequency and type of
POI device inspections performed match what is
defined in the entity’s targeted risk analysis
conducted for this requirement.
```

Customized Approach Objective
```
```
POI devices are inspected at a frequency that
addresses the entity’s risk.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Criminals will often pose as authorized
maintenance personnel to gain access to POI
devices.
Good Practice
Personnel training should include being alert to
and questioning anyone who shows up to do POI
maintenance to ensure they are authorized and
have a valid work order, including any agents,
maintenance or repair personnel, technicians,
service providers, or other third parties. All third
parties requesting access to devices should
always be verified before being provided
access—for example, by checking with
management or phoning the POI maintenance
company, such as the vendor or acquirer, for
verification. Many criminals will try to fool
personnel by dressing for the part (for example,
carrying toolboxes and dressed in work apparel),
and could also be knowledgeable about locations
of devices, so personnel should be trained to
always follow procedures.
Another trick that criminals use is to send a “new”
POI device with instructions for swapping it with a
legitimate device and “returning” the legitimate
device. The criminals may even provide return
postage to their specified address. Therefore,
personnel should always verify with their manager
or supplier that the device is legitimate and came
from a trusted source before installing it or using it
for business.
(continued on next page)
```
```
9.5.1.3 Training is provided for personnel in POI
environments to be aware of attempted tampering
or replacement of POI devices, and includes:
```
- Verifying the identity of any third-party persons
    claiming to be repair or maintenance personnel,
    before granting them access to modify or
    troubleshoot devices.
- Procedures to ensure devices are not installed,
    replaced, or returned without verification.
- Being aware of suspicious behavior around
    devices.
- Reporting suspicious behavior and indications of
    device tampering or substitution to appropriate
    personnel.

```
9.5.1.3.a Review training materials for personnel in
POI environments to verify they include all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
9.5.1.3.b Interview personnel in POI environments
to verify they have received training and know the
procedures for all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Personnel are knowledgeable about the types of
attacks against POI devices, the entity’s technical
and procedural countermeasures, and can access
assistance and guidance when required.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Examples
Suspicious behavior that personnel should be
aware of includes attempts by unknown persons
to unplug or open devices.
Ensuring personnel are aware of mechanisms for
reporting suspicious behavior and who to report
such behavior to—for example, a manager or
security officer—will help reduce the likelihood
and potential impact of a device being tampered
with or substituted.

documented.
10.2 Audit logs are implemented to support the detection of anomalies and suspicious activity, and the forensic analysis of events.
10.3 Audit logs are protected from destruction and unauthorized modifications.
10.4 Audit logs are reviewed to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.
10.5 Audit log history is retained and available for analysis.
10.6 Time-synchronization mechanisms support consistent time settings across all systems.
10.7 Failures of critical security control systems are detected, reported, and responded to promptly.
```
```
Overview
```
```
Logging mechanisms and the ability to track user activities are critical in preventing, detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data compromise.
The presence of logs on all system components and in the cardholder data environment (CDE) allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis
when something does go wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise is difficult, if not impossible, without system activity logs.
```
```
This requirement applies to user activities, including those by employees, contractors, consultants, and internal and external vendors, and other
third parties (for example, those providing support or maintenance services).
These requirements do not apply to user activity of consumers (cardholders).
Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 10.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 10.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 10, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives.
```
```
10.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 10
are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
10.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing
activities in Requirement 10 are documented,
assigned, and understood.
```
```
10.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that
descriptions of roles and responsibilities for

```
10.2 Audit logs are implemented to support the detection of anomalies and suspicious activity, and the forensic analysis of events.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Audit logs must exist for all system components.
Audit logs send alerts the system administrator,
provides data to other monitoring mechanisms,
such as intrusion-detection systems (IDS) and
security information and event monitoring
systems (SIEM) tools, and provide a history trail
for post-incident investigation.
Logging and analyzing security-relevant events
enable an organization to identify and trace
potentially malicious activities.
Good Practice
When an entity considers which information to
record in their logs, it is important to remember
that information stored in audit logs is sensitive
and should be protected per requirements in this
standard. Care should be taken to only store
essential information in the audit logs to minimize
risk.
```
```
10.2.1 Audit logs are enabled and active for all
system components and cardholder data.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Accounts with increased access privileges, such
as the “administrator” or “root” account, have the
potential to significantly impact the security or

cannot trace any issues resulting from an
administrative mistake or misuse of privilege back
to the specific action and account.
Definitions
Accounts with administrative access are those

10.3 Audit logs are protected from destruction and unauthorized modifications.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Audit log files contain sensitive information, and
read access to the log files must be limited only to
those with a valid business need. This access
includes audit log files on the originating systems
as well as anywhere else they are stored.
Good Practice
Adequate protection of the audit logs includes
strong access control that limits access to logs
based on “need to know” only and the use of
physical or network segregation to make the logs
harder to find and modify.
```
```
10.3.1 Read access to audit logs files is limited to
those with a job-related need.
```
```
10.3.1 Interview system administrators and
examine system configurations and privileges to
verify that only individuals with a job-related need
have read access to audit log files.

Stored activity records cannot be accessed by
unauthorized personnel.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Often a malicious individual who has entered the
network will try to edit the audit logs to hide their
activity. Without adequate protection of audit logs,
their completeness, accuracy, and integrity
cannot be guaranteed, and the audit logs can be
rendered useless as an investigation tool after a
compromise. Therefore, audit logs should be
protected on the originating systems as well as
anywhere else they are stored.
Good Practice
Entities should attempt to prevent logs from being
exposed in public-accessible locations.
```
```
10.3.2 Audit log files are protected to prevent
modifications by individuals.
```
```
10.3.2 Examine system configurations and
privileges and interview system administrators to
verify that current audit log files are protected from
modifications by individuals via access control
mechanisms, physical segregation, and/or network
Customized Approach Objective segregation.^
```
```
Stored activity records cannot be modified by
personnel.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Promptly backing up the logs to a centralized log
server or media that is difficult to alter keeps the
logs protected, even if the system generating the
logs becomes compromised.
Writing logs from external-facing technologies
such as wireless, network security controls, DNS,
and mail servers, reduces the risk of those logs
being lost or altered.
Good Practice
Each entity determines the best way to back up
log files, whether via one or more centralized log
servers or other secure media. Logs may be
written directly, offloaded, or copied from external
systems to the secure internal system or media.
```
```
10.3.3 Audit log files, including those for external-
facing technologies, are promptly backed up to a
secure, central, internal log server(s) or other media
that is difficult to modify.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
File integrity monitoring or change-detection
systems check for changes to critical files and
notify when such changes are identified. For file
integrity monitoring purposes, an entity usually
monitors files that do not regularly change, but
when changed, indicate a possible compromise.
Good Practice
Software used to monitor changes to audit logs
should be configured to provide alerts when
existing log data or files are changed or deleted.
However, new log data being added to an audit
log should not generate an alert.
```
```
10.3.4 File integrity monitoring or change-detection
mechanisms is used on audit logs to ensure that
existing log data cannot be changed without

10.4 Audit logs are reviewed to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Many breaches occur months before being
detected. Regular log reviews mean incidents can
be quickly identified and proactively addressed.
Good Practice
Checking logs daily (7 days a week, 365 days a
year, including holidays) minimizes the amount of
time and exposure of a potential breach. Log
harvesting, parsing, and alerting tools, centralized
log management systems, event log analyzers,
and security information and event management
(SIEM) solutions are examples of automated tools
that can be used to meet this requirement.
Daily review of security events—for example,
notifications or alerts that identify suspicious or
anomalous activities—as well as logs from critical
system components, and logs from systems that
perform security functions, such as firewalls,
IDS/IPS, file integrity monitoring (FIM) systems,
etc., is necessary to identify potential issues.
The determination of “security event” will vary for
each organization and may include consideration
for the type of technology, location, and function
of the device. Organizations may also wish to
maintain a baseline of “normal” traffic to help
identify anomalous behavior.
An entity that uses third-party service providers to
perform log review services is responsible to
provide context about the entity’s environment to
the service providers, so it understands the
entity’s environment, has a baseline of “normal”
traffic for the entity, and can detect potential
security issues and provide accurate exceptions
and anomaly notifications.
```
```
10.4.1 The following audit logs are reviewed at least
once daily:
```
- All security events.
- Logs of all system components that store,
    process, or transmit CHD and/or SAD.
- Logs of all critical system components.
- Logs of all servers and system components that
    perform security functions (for example, network
    security controls, intrusion-detection
    systems/intrusion-prevention systems (IDS/IPS),
    authentication servers).

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Manual log reviews are difficult to perform, even
for one or two systems, due to the amount of log
data that is generated. However, using log
harvesting, parsing, and alerting tools, centralized
log management systems, event log analyzers,
and security information and event management
(SIEM) solutions can help facilitate the process by
identifying log events that need to be reviewed.
Good Practice

any changes in their environment by periodically
reviewing tool settings and updating settings to
reflect any changes.

defining and managing exceptions and
anomalies:
```
- How log review activities are recorded,
- How to rank and prioritize exceptions and

10.5 Audit log history is retained and available for analysis.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Good Practice^
Retaining historical audit logs for at least 12
months is necessary because compromises often
go unnoticed for significant lengths of time.
Having centrally stored log history allows
investigators to better determine the length of
time a potential breach was occurring, and the
possible system(s) impacted. By having three
months of logs immediately available, an entity
can quickly identify and minimize impact of a data
breach.
Examples
Methods that allow logs to be immediately
available include storing logs online, archiving
logs, or restoring logs quickly from backups.
```
```
10.5.1 Retain audit log history for at least 12
months, with at least the most recent three months
immediately available for analysis.
```

10.6 Time-synchronization mechanisms support consistent time settings across all systems.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Time synchronization technology is used to
synchronize clocks on multiple systems. When
clocks are not properly synchronized, it can be
difficult, if not impossible, to compare log files
from different systems and establish an exact
sequence of events, which is crucial for forensic
analysis following a breach.
For post-incident forensics teams, the accuracy
and consistency of time across all systems and
the time of each activity are critical in determining
how the systems were compromised.
Examples
Network Time Protocol (NTP) is one example of
time-synchronization technology.
```
```
10.6.1 System clocks and time are synchronized
using time-synchronization technology.
```
```
10.6.1 Examine system configuration settings to
verify that time-synchronization technology is
implemented and kept current.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Common time is established across all systems.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
Keeping time-synchronization technology current
includes managing vulnerabilities and patching the
technology according to PCI DSS Requirements
6.3.1 and 6.3.3.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Using reputable time servers is a critical
component of the time synchronization process.
Accepting time updates from specific, industry-
accepted external sources helps prevent a
malicious individual from changing time settings
on systems.
Good Practice
Another option to prevent unauthorized use of
internal time servers is to encrypt updates with a
symmetric key and create access control lists that
specify the IP addresses of client machines that
will be provided with the time updates.
```
```
10.6.2 Systems are configured to the correct and
consistent time as follows:
```
- One or more designated time servers are in use.
- Only the designated central time server(s)
    receives time from external sources.
- Time received from external sources is based on
    International Atomic Time or Coordinated
    Universal Time (UTC).
- The designated time server(s) accept time
    updates only from specific industry-accepted
    external sources.
- Where there is more than one designated time
    server, the time servers peer with one another to
    keep accurate time.
- Internal systems receive time information only
    from designated central time server(s).

```
10.6.2 Examine system configuration settings for
acquiring, distributing, and storing the correct time
to verify the settings are configured in accordance
with all elements specified in this requirement.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
11.1 Processes and mechanisms for regularly testing security of systems and networks are defined and understood.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 11.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 11.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 11, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives.
```
```
11.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 11
are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```
11.1.1 Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that security policies and
operational procedures are managed in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting
activities within Requirement 11 are defined and
adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting
activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and
conform to management’s intent.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
11.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing
activities in Requirement 11 are documented,
assigned, and understood.
```
```
11.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that
descriptions of roles and responsibilities for
performing activities in Requirement 11 are
documented and assigned.
```
```
11.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility for
performing activities in Requirement 11 to verify
that roles and responsibilities are assigned as
documented and are understood.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the
activities in Requirement 11 are allocated.
Personnel are accountable for successful,
continuous operation of these requirements.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
11.2 Wireless access points are identified and monitored, and unauthorized wireless access points are addressed.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Implementation and/or exploitation of wireless
technology within a network are common paths
for malicious users to gain unauthorized access to
the network and cardholder data. Unauthorized
wireless devices could be hidden within or
attached to a computer or other system
component. These devices could also be
attached directly to a network port, to a network
device such as a switch or router, or inserted as a
wireless interface card inside a system
component.
If a wireless device or network is installed without
a company’s knowledge, it can allow an attacker
to enter the network easily and “invisibly.”
Detecting and removing such unauthorized
access points reduces the duration and likelihood
of such devices being leveraged for an attack.
Good Practice
The size and complexity of an environment will
dictate the appropriate tools and processes to be
used to provide sufficient assurance that a rogue
wireless access point has not been installed in the
environment.
(continued on next page)
```
```
11.2.1 Authorized and unauthorized wireless access
points are managed as follows:
```
- The presence of wireless (Wi-Fi) access points is
    tested for,
- All authorized and unauthorized wireless access
    points are detected and identified,
- Testing, detection, and identification occurs at
    least once every three months.
- If automated monitoring is used, personnel are
    notified via generated alerts.

```
11.2.1.a Examine policies and procedures to verify
processes are defined for managing both
authorized and unauthorized wireless access
points with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
11.2.1.b Examine the methodology(ies) in use and
the resulting documentation, and interview
personnel to verify processes are defined to detect
and identify both authorized and unauthorized
wireless access points in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
11.2.1.c Examine wireless assessment results and
interview personnel to verify that wireless
assessments were conducted in accordance with
all elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
11.2.1.d If automated monitoring is used, examine
configuration settings to verify the configuration will
Customized Approach Objective generate alerts to notify personnel.^
```
```
Unauthorized wireless access points are identified
and addressed periodically.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
The requirement applies even when a policy exists
that prohibits the use of wireless technology since
attackers do not read and follow company policy.
Methods used to meet this requirement must be
sufficient to detect and identify both authorized and
unauthorized devices, including unauthorized
devices attached to devices that themselves are
authorized.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
For example, performing a detailed physical
inspection of a single stand-alone retail kiosk in a
shopping mall, where all communication
components are contained within tamper-resistant
and tamper-evident casings, may be sufficient to
provide assurance that a rogue wireless access
point has not been attached or installed.
However, in an environment with multiple nodes
(such as in a large retail store, call center, server
room or data center), detailed physical inspection
can be difficult. In this case, multiple methods
may be combined, such as performing physical
system inspections in conjunction with the results
of a wireless analyzer.
Definitions
This is also referred to as rogue access point
detection.
Examples
Methods that may be used include but are not
limited to wireless network scans, physical/logical
inspections of system components and
infrastructure, network access control (NAC), or
wireless IDS/IPS. NAC and wireless IDS/IPS are
examples of automated monitoring tools.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
An inventory of authorized wireless access points
can help administrators quickly respond when
unauthorized wireless access points are detected.
This helps to proactively minimize the exposure of
CDE to malicious individuals.
Good Practice
If using a wireless scanner, it is equally important
to have a defined list of known access points
which, while not attached to the company’s
network, will usually be detected during a scan.
These non-company devices are often found in
multi-tenant buildings or businesses located near
one another. However, it is important to verify that
these devices are not connected to the entity’s
network port or through another network-
connected device and given an SSID resembling
a nearby business. Scan results should note such
devices and how it was determined that these
devices could be “ignored.” In addition, detection
of any unauthorized wireless access points that
are determined to be a threat to the CDE should
be managed following the entity’s incident
response plan per Requirement 12.10.1.
```
```
11.2.2 An inventory of authorized wireless access
points is maintained, including a documented
business justification.
```
```
11.2.2 Examine documentation to verify that an
inventory of authorized wireless access points is
maintained, and a business justification is
documented for all authorized wireless access
points.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Unauthorized wireless access points are not
mistaken for authorized wireless access points.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
11.3 External and internal vulnerabilities are regularly identified, prioritized, and addressed.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Identifying and addressing vulnerabilities promptly
reduces the likelihood of a vulnerability being
exploited and the potential compromise of a
system component or cardholder data.
Vulnerability scans conducted at least every three
months provide this detection and identification.
Good Practice
Vulnerabilities posing the greatest risk to the
environment (for example, ranked high or critical
per Requirement 6.3.1) should be resolved with
the highest priority.
Multiple scan reports can be combined for the
quarterly scan process to show that all systems
were scanned and all applicable vulnerabilities
were resolved as part of the three-month
vulnerability scan cycle. However, additional,
documentation may be required to verify non-
remediated vulnerabilities are in the process of
being resolved.
While scans are required at least once every
three months, more frequent scans are
recommended depending on the network
complexity, frequency of change, and types of
devices, software, and operating systems used.
Definitions
A vulnerability scan is a combination of
automated tools, techniques, and/or methods run
against external and internal devices and servers,
designed to expose potential vulnerabilities in
applications, operating systems, and network
devices that could be found and exploited by
malicious individuals.
```
```
11.3.1 Internal vulnerability scans are performed as
follows:
```
- At least once every three months.
- High-risk and critical vulnerabilities (per the
    entity’s vulnerability risk rankings defined at
    Requirement 6.3.1) are resolved.
- Rescans are performed that confirm all high-
risk and critical vulnerabilities (as noted above)
have been resolved.
- Scan tool is kept up to date with latest
    vulnerability information.
- Scans are performed by qualified personnel and
    organizational independence of the tester exists.

```
11.3.1.a Examine internal scan report results from
the last 12 months to verify that internal scans
occurred at least once every three months in the
most recent 12-month period.
```
```
11.3.1.b Examine internal scan report results from
each scan and rescan run in the last 12 months to
verify that all high-risk and critical vulnerabilities
(identified in PCI DSS Requirement 6.3.1) are
resolved.
```
```
11.3.1.c Examine scan tool configurations and
interview personnel to verify that the scan tool is
kept up to date with the latest vulnerability
information.
```
```
11.3.1.d Interview responsible personnel to verify
that the scan was performed by a qualified internal
resource(s) or qualified external third party and that
organizational independence of the tester exists.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The security posture of all system components is
verified periodically using automated tools designed
to detect vulnerabilities operating inside the
network. Detected vulnerabilities are assessed and
rectified based on a formal risk assessment
framework. (continued on next page)
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Applicability Notes^
```
```
It is not required to use a QSA or ASV to conduct
internal vulnerability scans.
Internal vulnerability scans can be performed by
qualified, internal staff that are reasonably
independent of the system component(s) being
scanned (for example, a network administrator
should not be responsible for scanning the network),
or an entity may choose to have internal
vulnerability scans performed by a firm specializing
in vulnerability scanning.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
All vulnerabilities, regardless of criticality, provide
a potential avenue of attack and must therefore
be addressed periodically, with the vulnerabilities
that expose the most risk addressed more quickly
to limit the potential window of attack.
```
```
11.3.1.1 All other applicable vulnerabilities (those
not ranked as high-risk or critical per the entity’s
vulnerability risk rankings defined at Requirement
6.3.1) are managed as follows:
```
- Addressed based on the risk defined in the
    entity’s targeted risk analysis, which is
    performed according to all elements specified
    in Requirement 12.3.1.
- Rescans are conducted as needed.

```
11.3.1.1.a Examine the entity’s targeted risk
analysis that defines the risk for addressing all
other applicable vulnerabilities (those not ranked
as high-risk or critical per the entity’s vulnerability
risk rankings at Requirement 6.3.1) to verify the
risk analysis was performed in accordance with all
elements specified at Requirement 12.3.1.
```
```
11.3.1.1.b Interview responsible personnel and
examine internal scan report results or other
documentation to verify that all other applicable
vulnerabilities (those not ranked as high-risk or
critical per the entity’s vulnerability risk rankings at
Requirement 6.3.1) are addressed based on the
risk defined in the entity’s targeted risk analysis,
and that the scan process includes rescans as
needed to confirm the vulnerabilities have been
addressed.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Lower ranked vulnerabilities (lower than high or
critical) are addressed at a frequency in accordance
with the entity’s risk.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
The timeframe for addressing lower-risk
vulnerabilities is subject to the results of a risk
analysis per Requirement 12.3.1 that includes
(minimally) identification of assets being protected,
threats, and likelihood and/or impact of a threat
being realized.
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Authenticated scanning provides greater insight
into an entity’s vulnerability landscape since it can
detect vulnerabilities that unauthenticated scans
cannot detect. Attackers may leverage
vulnerabilities that an entity is unaware of
because certain vulnerabilities will only be
detected with authenticated scanning.
Authenticated scanning can yield significant
additional information about an organization’s
vulnerabilities.
Good Practice
The credentials used for these scans should be
considered highly privileged. They should be
protected and controlled as such, following PCI
DSS Requirements 7 and 8 (except for those
requirements for multi-factor authentication and
application and system accounts).
```
```
11.3.1.2 Internal vulnerability scans are performed
via authenticated scanning as follows:
```
- Systems that are unable to accept credentials for
    authenticated scanning are documented.
- Sufficient privileges are used for those systems
    that accept credentials for scanning.
- If accounts used for authenticated scanning can
    be used for interactive login, they are managed
    in accordance with Requirement 8.2.2.

```
11.3.1.2.a Examine scan tool configurations to
verify that authenticated scanning is used for
internal scans, with sufficient privileges, for those
systems that accept credentials for scanning.
```
```
11.3.1.2.b Examine scan report results and
interview personnel to verify that authenticated
scans are performed.
```
```
11.3.1.2.c If accounts used for authenticated
scanning can be used for interactive login,
examine the accounts and interview personnel to
verify the accounts are managed following all
elements specified in Requirement 8.2.2.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Automated tools used to detect vulnerabilities can
detect vulnerabilities local to each system, which
are not visible remotely.
```
```
11.3.1.2.d Examine documentation to verify that
systems that are unable to accept credentials for
authenticated scanning are defined.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
The authenticated scanning tools can be either
host-based or network-based.
“Sufficient” privileges are those needed to access
system resources such that a thorough scan can be
conducted that detects known vulnerabilities.
This requirement does not apply to system
components that cannot accept credentials for
scanning. Examples of systems that may not accept
credentials for scanning include some network and
security appliances, mainframes, and containers.
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Attackers routinely look for unpatched or
vulnerable externally facing servers, which can be
leveraged to launch a directed attack.
Organizations must ensure these externally facing
devices are regularly scanned for weaknesses
and that vulnerabilities are patched or remediated
to protect the entity.
Because external networks are at greater risk of
compromise, external vulnerability scanning must
be performed at least once every three months by
a PCI SSC Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV).
Good Practice
While scans are required at least once every
three months, more frequent scans are
recommended depending on the network
complexity, frequency of change, and types of
devices, software, and operating systems used.
Multiple scan reports can be combined to show
that all systems were scanned and that all
applicable vulnerabilities were resolved as part of
the three-month vulnerability scan cycle.
However, additional documentation may be
required to verify non-remediated vulnerabilities
are in the process of being resolved.
```
```
11.3.2 External vulnerability scans are performed as
follows:
```
- At least once every three months.
- By a PCI SSC Approved Scanning Vendor

Applicability Notes
```
```
For initial PCI DSS compliance, it is not required that
four passing scans be completed within 12 months if
the assessor verifies: 1) the most recent scan result
was a passing scan, 2) the entity has documented
policies and procedures requiring scanning at least
once every three months, and 3) vulnerabilities
noted in the scan results have been corrected as
shown in a re-scan(s).
(continued on next page)
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
However, for subsequent years after the initial PCI
DSS assessment, passing scans at least every three
months must have occurred.
ASV scanning tools can scan a vast array of
network types and topologies. Any specifics about
the target environment (for example, load balancers,
third-party providers, ISPs, specific configurations,
protocols in use, scan interference) should be
worked out between the ASV and scan customer.

11.4 External and internal penetration testing is regularly performed, and exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses are corrected.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Attackers spend a lot of time finding external and
internal vulnerabilities to leverage to obtain
access to cardholder data and then to exfiltrate
that data. As such, entities need to test their
networks thoroughly, just as an attacker would do.
This testing allows the entity to identify and
remediate weakness that might be leveraged to
compromise the entity’s network and data, and
then to take appropriate actions to protect the
network and system components from such
attacks.
Good Practice
Penetration testing techniques will differ based on
an organization’s needs and structure and should
be suitable for the tested environment—for
example, fuzzing, injection, and forgery tests
might be appropriate. The type, depth, and
complexity of the testing will depend on the
specific environment and the needs of the
organization.
Definitions
Penetration tests simulate a real-world attack
situation intending to identify how far an attacker
could penetrate an environment, given differing
amounts of information provided to the tester.
This allows an entity to better understand its
potential exposure and develop a strategy to
defend against attacks. A penetration test differs
from a vulnerability scan, as a penetration test is
an active process that usually includes exploiting
identified vulnerabilities.
```
```
(continued on next page)
```
```
11.4.1 A penetration testing methodology is defined,
documented, and implemented by the entity, and
includes:
```
- Industry-accepted penetration testing
    approaches.
- Coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and
    critical systems.
- Testing from both inside and outside the
    network.
- Testing to validate any segmentation and scope-
    reduction controls.
- Application-layer penetration testing to identify,
    at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in
    Requirement 6.2.4.
- Network-layer penetration tests that encompass
    all components that support network functions as
    well as operating systems.
- Review and consideration of threats and

Applicability Notes^ Scanning for vulnerabilities alone is not a
penetration test, nor is a penetration test
adequate if the focus is solely on trying to exploit
vulnerabilities found in a vulnerability scan.
Conducting a vulnerability scan may be one of the
first steps, but it is not the only step a penetration
tester will perform to plan the testing strategy.
Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known
vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often
gain enough knowledge about the system to
identify possible security gaps.
Penetration testing is a highly manual process.
While some automated tools may be used, the
tester uses their knowledge of systems to gain
access into an environment. Often the tester will
chain several types of exploits together with the
goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For
example, if the tester finds a way to gain access
to an application server, the tester will then use
the compromised server as a point to stage a new
attack based on the resources to which the server
has access. In this way, a tester can simulate the
techniques used by an attacker to identify areas
of potential weakness in the environment. The
testing of security monitoring and detection
methods—for example, to confirm the
effectiveness of logging and file integrity
monitoring mechanisms, should also be
considered.

Testing from inside the network (or “internal
penetration testing”) means testing from both inside
the CDE and into the CDE from trusted and
untrusted internal networks.
Testing from outside the network (or “external
penetration testing”) means testing the exposed
external perimeter of trusted networks, and critical
systems connected to or accessible to public
network infrastructures.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose
Internal penetration testing serves two purposes.
Firstly, just like an external penetration test, it
discovers vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
that could be used by an attacker that had
managed to get some degree of access to the
internal network, whether that is because the
attacker is an authorized user conducting
unauthorized activities, or an external attacker
that had managed to penetrate the entity’s
perimeter.
Secondly, internal penetration testing also helps
entities to discover where their change control
process failed by detecting previously unknown
systems. Additionally, it verifies the status of
many of the controls operating within the CDE.
A penetration test is not truly a “test” because the
outcome of a penetration test is not something
that can be classified as a “pass” or a “fail.” The
best outcome of a test is a catalog of
vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that an entity
did not know about and the penetration tester
found them before an attacker could. A
penetration test that found nothing is typically
indicative of shortcomings of the penetration
tester, rather than being a positive reflection of
the security posture of the entity.
Good Practice
Some considerations when choosing a qualified
resource to perform penetration testing include:
```
- Specific penetration testing certifications,
    which may be an indication of the tester’s skill
    level and competence.

```
(continued on next page)

```
11.4.2 Internal penetration testing is performed:
```
- Per the entity’s defined methodology,
- At least once every 12 months
- After any significant infrastructure or application
    upgrade or change
- By a qualified internal resource or qualified
    external third-party
- Organizational independence of the tester exists
    (not required to be a QSA or ASV).

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The results of a penetration test are usually a
prioritized list of vulnerabilities discovered by the
exercise. Often a tester will have chained a
number of vulnerabilities together to compromise
a system component. Remediating the
vulnerabilities found by a penetration test
significantly reduces the probability that the same
vulnerabilities will be exploited by a malicious
attacker.
Using the entity’s own vulnerability risk
assessment process (see requirement 6.3.1)
ensures that the vulnerabilities that pose the
highest risk to the entity will be remediated more
quickly.
Good Practice
As part of the entity’s assessment of risk, entities
should consider how likely the vulnerability is to
be exploited and whether there are other controls
present in the environment to reduce the risk.
Any weaknesses that point to PCI DSS
requirements not being met should be addressed.
```
```
11.4.4 Exploitable vulnerabilities and security
weaknesses found during penetration testing are
corrected as follows:
```
- In accordance with the entity’s assessment of
    the risk posed by the security issue as defined in
    Requirement 6.3.1.
- Penetration testing is repeated to verify the
    corrections.

```

that noted exploitable vulnerabilities and security
weaknesses were corrected in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
When an entity uses segmentation controls to
isolate the CDE from internal untrusted networks,
the security of the CDE is dependent on that
segmentation functioning. Many attacks have
involved the attacker moving laterally from what
an entity deemed an isolated network into the
CDE. Using penetration testing tools and
techniques to validate that an untrusted network
is indeed isolated from the CDE can alert the
entity to a failure or misconfiguration of the
segmentation controls, which can then be
rectified.
Good Practice
Techniques such as host discovery and port
scanning can be used to verify out-of-scope
segments have no access to the CDE.
```
```
11.4.5 If segmentation is used to isolate the CDE
from other networks, penetration tests are
performed on segmentation controls as follows:
```
- At least once every 12 months and after any
    changes to segmentation controls/methods
- Covering all segmentation controls/methods in
    use.
- According to the entity’s defined penetration
    testing methodology.
- Confirming that the segmentation
    controls/methods are operational and effective,
    and isolate the CDE from all out-of-scope
    systems.
- Confirming effectiveness of any use of isolation
    to separate systems with differing security levels
    (see Requirement 2.2.3).
- Performed by a qualified internal resource or
    qualified external third party.
- Organizational independence of the tester exists
    (not required to be a QSA or ASV).

that penetration-testing procedures are defined to
test all segmentation methods in accordance with
all elements specified in this requirement.

```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
If segmentation is used, it is verified periodically by
technical testing to be continually effective, including
after any changes, in isolating the CDE from all out-
of-scope systems.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Service providers typically have access to greater
volumes of cardholder data or can provide an
entry point that can be exploited to then
compromise multiple other entities. Service
providers also typically have larger and more
complex networks that are subject to more
frequent change. The probability of segmentation
controls failing in complex and dynamic networks
is greater in service provider environments.
Validating segmentation controls more frequently
is likely to discover such failings before they can
be exploited by an attacker attempting to pivot
laterally from an out-of-scope untrusted network
to the CDE.
Good Practice
Although the requirement specifies that this scope
validation is carried out at least once every six
months and after significant change, this exercise
should be performed as frequently as possible to
ensure it remains effective at isolating the CDE
from other networks.
```
```
11.4.6 Additional requirement for service
providers only: If segmentation is used to isolate
the CDE from other networks, penetration tests are
performed on segmentation controls as follows:
```
- At least once every six months and after any
    changes to segmentation controls/methods.
- Covering all segmentation controls/methods in
use.
- According to the entity’s defined penetration
testing methodology.
- Confirming that the segmentation
controls/methods are operational and effective,
and isolate the CDE from all out-of-scope

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Entities need to conduct penetration tests in
accordance with PCI DSS to simulate attacker
behavior and discover vulnerabilities in their
environment. In shared and cloud environments,
the multi-tenant service provider may be
concerned about the activities of a penetration
tester affecting other customers’ systems.
Multi-tenant service providers cannot forbid
penetration testing because this would leave their
customers’ systems open to exploitation.
Therefore, multi-tenant service providers must
support customer requests to conduct penetration
testing or for penetration testing results.
```
```
11.4.7 Additional requirement for multi-tenant
service providers only: Multi-tenant service
providers support their customers for external
penetration testing per Requirement 11.4.3 and
11.4.4.

11.4.7 Additional testing procedure for multi-
tenant service providers only: Examine evidence
to verify that multi-tenant service providers support
their customers for external penetration testing per
Requirement 11.4.3 and 11.4.4.

Multi-tenant service providers support their
customers’ need for technical testing either by
providing access or evidence that comparable
technical testing has been undertaken.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
This requirement applies only when the entity being
assessed is a multi-tenant service provider.
To meet this requirement, a multi-tenant service
provider may either:
```
- Provide evidence to its customers to show that
    penetration testing has been performed
    according to Requirements 11.4.3 and 11.4.4 on
    the customers’ subscribed infrastructure, or
- Provide prompt access to each of its customers,
    so customers can perform their own penetration
    testing.
Evidence provided to customers can include
redacted penetration testing results but needs to
include sufficient information to prove that all
elements of Requirements 11.4.3 and 11.4.4 have
been met on the customer’s behalf.
Refer also to _Appendix A1: Additional PCI DSS
Requirements for Multi-Tenant Service Providers_.

11.5 Network intrusions and unexpected file changes are detected and responded to.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention
techniques (such as IDS/IPS) compare the traffic
coming into the network with known “signatures”
and/or behaviors of thousands of compromise
types (hacker tools, Trojans, and other malware),
and then send alerts and/or stop the attempt as it
happens. Without a proactive approach to detect
unauthorized activity, attacks on (or misuse of)
computer resources could go unnoticed for long
periods of time. The impact of an intrusion into the
CDE is, in many ways, a factor of the time that an
attacker has in the environment before being
detected.
(continued on next page)
```
```
11.5.1 Intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-
prevention techniques are used to detect and/or
prevent intrusions into the network as follows:
```
- All traffic is monitored at the perimeter of the
    CDE.
- All traffic is monitored at critical points in the
    CDE.
- Personnel are alerted to suspected
    compromises.
- All intrusion-detection and prevention engines,
    baselines, and signatures are kept up to date.

```
11.5.1.a Examine system configurations and
network diagrams to verify that intrusion-detection
and/or intrusion-prevention techniques are in place
to monitor all traffic:
```
- At the perimeter of the CDE.
- At critical points in the CDE.

```
11.5.1.b Examine system configurations and
interview responsible personnel to verify intrusion-
detection and/or intrusion-prevention techniques
alert personnel of suspected compromises.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

Customized Approach Objective 11.5.1.c^ Examine system configurations and
vendor documentation to verify intrusion-detection
and/or intrusion-prevention techniques are
configured to keep all engines, baselines, and
signatures up to date.
```
```
Good Practice
Security alerts generated by these techniques
should be continually monitored, so that the
attempted or actual intrusions can be stopped,
and potential damage limited.
Definitions
Critical locations could include, but are not limited
to, network security controls between network
segments (for example, between a DMZ and an
internal network or between an in-scope and out-
of-scope network) and points protecting
connections between a less trusted and a more
trusted system component.
```
```
Mechanisms to detect real-time suspicious or
anomalous network traffic that may be indicative of
threat actor activity are implemented. Alerts
generated by these mechanisms are responded to
by personnel, or by automated means that ensure
that system components cannot be compromised as
a result of the detected activity.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Detecting covert malware communication
attempts (for example, DNS tunneling) can help
block the spread of malware laterally inside a
network and the exfiltration of data. When
deciding where to place this control, entities
should consider critical locations in the network,
and likely routes for covert channels.
When malware establishes a foothold in an
infected environment, it often tries to establish a
communication channel to a command-and-
control (C&C) server. Through the C&C server,
the attacker communicates with and controls
malware on compromised systems to deliver
malicious payloads or instructions, or to initiate
data exfiltration. In many cases, the malware will
communicate with the C&C server indirectly via
botnets, bypassing monitoring, blocking controls,
and rendering these methods ineffective to detect
the covert channels.
Good Practice
Methods that can help detect and address
malware communications channels include real-
time endpoint scanning, egress traffic filtering, an
”allow” listing, data loss prevention tools, and
network security monitoring tools such as
IDS/IPS. Additionally, DNS queries and
responses are a key data source used by network
defenders in support of incident response as well
as intrusion discovery. When these transactions
are collected for processing and analytics, they
can enable a number of valuable security analytic
scenarios.
It is important that organizations maintain up-to-
date knowledge of malware modes of operation,
as mitigating these can help detect and limit the
impact of malware in the environment.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Changes to critical system, configuration, or
content files can be an indicator an attacker has
accessed an organization’s system. Such
changes can allow an attacker to take additional
malicious actions, access cardholder data, and/or
conduct activities without detection or record.
A change detection mechanism will detect and
evaluate such changes to critical files and
generate alerts that can be responded to following
defined processes so that personnel can take
appropriate actions.
If not implemented properly and the output of the
change-detection solution monitored, a malicious
individual could add, remove, or alter
configuration file contents, operating system
programs, or application executables.
Unauthorized changes, if undetected, could
render existing security controls ineffective and/or
result in cardholder data being stolen with no
perceptible impact to normal processing.
Good Practice
Examples of the types of files that should be
monitored include, but are not limited to:
```
- System executables.
- Application executables.
- Configuration and parameter files.
- Centrally stored, historical, or archived audit
    logs.
- Additional critical files determined by entity (for
    example, through risk assessment or other
    means).
**Examples**
Change-detection solutions such as file integrity
monitoring (FIM) tools check for changes,
additions, and deletions to critical files, and notify
when such changes are detected.

```
11.5.2 A change-detection mechanism (for example,
file integrity monitoring tools) is deployed as follows:
```
- To alert personnel to unauthorized modification
    (including changes, additions, and deletions) of
    critical files.
- To perform critical file comparisons at least
    once weekly.

```
11.5.2.a Examine system settings, monitored files,
and results from monitoring activities to verify the
use of a change-detection mechanism.
```
```
11.5.2.b Examine settings for the change-detection
mechanism to verify it is configured in accordance
with all elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Critical files cannot be modified by unauthorized
personnel without an alert being generated.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
For change-detection purposes, critical files are
usually those that do not regularly change, but the
modification of which could indicate a system
compromise or risk of compromise. Change-
detection mechanisms such as file integrity
monitoring products usually come pre-configured
with critical files for the related operating system.
Other critical files, such as those for custom
applications, must be evaluated and defined by the
entity (that is, the merchant or service provider).

11.6 Unauthorized changes on payment pages are detected and responded to.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Many web pages now rely on assembling objects,
including active content (primarily JavaScript),
from multiple internet locations. Additionally, the
content of many web pages is defined using
content management and tag management
systems that may not be possible to monitor using
traditional change detection mechanisms.
Therefore, the only place to detect changes or
indicators of malicious activity is in the consumer
browser as the page is constructed and all
JavaScript interpreted.
By comparing the current version of the HTTP
header and the active content of payment pages
as received by the consumer browser with prior or
known versions, it is possible to detect
unauthorized changes that may indicate a
skimming attack.
Additionally, by looking for known indicators of
compromise and script elements or behavior
typical of skimmers, suspicious alerts can be
raised.
(continued on next page)

- To alert personnel to unauthorized modification
    (including indicators of compromise, changes,
    additions, and deletions) to the HTTP headers
    and the contents of payment pages as received
    by the consumer browser.
- The mechanism is configured to evaluate the
    received HTTP header and payment page.
- The mechanism functions are performed as
    follows:
       - At least once every seven days
          **OR**
       - Periodically (at the frequency defined in the

- At the frequency defined in the entity’s targeted
    risk analysis performed for this requirement.

```
Customized Approach Objective
```

Applicability Notes^ Examples^
Mechanisms that detect and report on changes to
the headers and content of the payment page
include but are not limited to:
```
- Violations of the Content Security Policy (CSP)
    can be reported to the entity using the _report-_
    _to_ or _report-uri_ CSP directives.
- Changes to the CSP itself can indicate
    tampering.
- External monitoring by systems that request
    and analyze the received web pages (also
    known as synthetic user monitoring) can
    detect changes to JavaScript in payment
    pages and alert personnel.
- Embedding tamper-resistant, tamper-detection
    script in the payment page can alert and block
    when malicious script behavior is detected.
- Reverse proxies and Content Delivery
    Networks can detect changes in scripts and
    alert personnel.
Often, these mechanisms are subscription or
cloud-based, but can also be based on custom
and bespoke solutions.

```
The intention of this requirement is not that an entity
installs software in the systems or browsers of its
consumers, but rather that the entity uses
techniques such as those described under
Examples in the Guidance column to prevent and
detect unexpected script activities.
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

```
```
Overview
```
```
The organization’s overall information security policy sets the tone for the whole entity and informs personnel what is expected of them. All
personnel should be aware of the sensitivity of cardholder data and their responsibilities for protecting it.
```
```
For the purposes of Requirement 12, “personnel” refers to full-time and part-time employees, temporary employees, contractors, and
consultants with security responsibilities for protecting account data or that can impact the security of account data.
Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
12.1 A comprehensive information security policy that governs and provides direction for protection of the entity’s information assets is known and current.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
An organization’s overall information security
policy ties to and governs all other policies and
procedures that define protection of cardholder
data.
The information security policy communicates
management’s intent and objectives regarding the
protection of its most valuable assets, including
cardholder data.
Without an information security policy, individuals
will make their own value decisions on the
controls that are required within the organization
which may result in the organization neither
meeting its legal, regulatory, and contractual
obligations, nor being able to adequately protect
its assets in a consistent manner.
To ensure the policy is implemented, it is
important that all relevant personnel within the
organization, as well as relevant third parties,
vendors, and business partners are aware of the
organization’s information security policy and their
responsibilities for protecting information assets.
(continued on next page)
```
```
12.1.1 An overall information security policy is:
```
- Established.
- Published.
- Maintained.
- Disseminated to all relevant personnel, as well
    as to relevant vendors and business partners.

```
12.1.1 Examine the information security policy and
interview personnel to verify that the overall
information security policy is managed in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The strategic objectives and principles of
information security are defined, adopted, and
known to all personnel.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Good Practice
The security policy for the organization identifies
the purpose, scope, accountability, and
information that clearly defines the organization’s
position regarding information security.
The overall information security policy differs from
individual security policies that address specific
technology or security disciplines. This policy sets
forth the directives for the entire organization
whereas individual security policies align and
support the overall security policy and
communicate specific objectives for technology or
security disciplines.
It is important that all relevant personnel within
the organization, as well as relevant third parties,
vendors, and business partners are aware of the
organization’s information security policy and their
responsibilities for protecting information assets.
Definitions
“Relevant” for this requirement means that the
information security policy is disseminated to
those with roles applicable to some or all the
topics in the policy, either within the company or
because of services/functions performed by a
vendor or third party.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Security threats and associated protection
methods evolve rapidly. Without updating the
information security policy to reflect relevant
changes, new measures to defend against these
threats may not be addressed.
```
```
12.1.2 The information security policy is:
```
- Reviewed at least once every 12 months.
- Updated as needed to reflect changes to
    business objectives or risks to the environment.

```
12.1.2 Examine the information security policy and
interview responsible personnel to verify the policy
is managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The information security policy continues to reflect
the organization’s strategic objectives and
principles.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without clearly defined security roles and
responsibilities assigned, there could be misuse
of the organization’s information assets or
inconsistent interaction with information security
personnel, leading to insecure implementation of
technologies or use of outdated or insecure
technologies.
```
```
12.1.3 The security policy clearly defines
information security roles and responsibilities for all
personnel, and all personnel are aware of and
acknowledge their information security
responsibilities.
```
```
12.1.3.a Examine the information security policy to
verify that they clearly define information security
roles and responsibilities for all personnel.
```
```
12.1.3.b Interview personnel in various roles to
verify they understand their information security
responsibilities.
```
```
12.1.3.c Examine documented evidence to verify
personnel acknowledge their information security
Customized Approach Objective responsibilities.^
```
```
Personnel understand their role in protecting the
entity’s cardholder data.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose
To ensure someone with sufficient authority and
responsibility is actively managing and
championing the organization’s information
security program, accountability and responsibility
for information security needs to be assigned at
the executive level within an organization.
Common executive management titles for this
role include Chief Information Security Officer
(CISO) and Chief Security Officer (CSO – to meet
this requirement, the CSO role must be
responsible for information security). These
positions are often at the most senior level of
management and are part of the chief executive
level or C-level, typically reporting to the Chief
Executive Officer or the Board of Directors.
Good Practice
Entities should also consider transition and/or
succession plans for these key personnel to avoid
potential gaps in critical security activities.
```
```
12.1.4 Responsibility for information security is
formally assigned to a Chief Information Security
Officer or other information security knowledgeable
member of executive management.
```
```
12.1.4 Examine the information security policy to
verify that information security is formally assigned
to a Chief Information Security Officer or other
information security-knowledgeable member of
executive management.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
A designated member of executive management is
responsible for information security.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
12.2 Acceptable use policies for end-user technologies are defined and implemented.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
End-user technologies are a significant
investment and may pose significant risk to an
organization if not managed properly. Acceptable
use policies outline the expected behavior from
personnel when using the organization’s
information technology and reflect the
organization’s risk tolerance
These policies instruct personnel on what they
can and cannot do with company equipment and
instruct personnel on correct and incorrect uses of
company Internet and email resources. Such
policies can legally protect an organization and
allow it to act when the policies are violated.
Good Practice
It is important that usage policies are supported
by technical controls to manage the enforcement
of the policies.
Structuring polices as simple “do” and “do not”
requirements that are linked to a purpose can
help remove ambiguity and provide personnel
with the context for the requirement.
```
```
12.2.1 Acceptable use policies for end-user
technologies are documented and implemented,
including:
```
- Explicit approval by authorized parties.
- Acceptable uses of the technology.
- List of products approved by the company for
    employee use, including hardware and software.

```
12.2.1 Examine the acceptable use policies for
end-user technologies and interview responsible
personnel to verify processes are documented and
implemented in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The use of end-user technologies is defined and
managed to ensure authorized usage.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
Examples of end-user technologies for which
acceptable use policies are expected include, but
are not limited to, remote access and wireless
technologies, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, and
removable electronic media, email usage, and
Internet usage.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
12.3 Risks to the cardholder data environment are formally identified, evaluated, and managed.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Some PCI DSS requirements allow an entity to
define how frequently an activity is performed
based on the risk to environment. Performing this
risk analysis according to a methodology ensures
validity and consistency with policies and
procedures.
This targeted risk analysis (as opposed to a
traditional enterprise-wide risk assessment)
focuses on those PCI DSS requirements that
all ow an entity flexibility about how frequently an
entity performs a given control. For this risk
analysis, the entity carefully evaluates each PCI
DSS requirement that provides this flexibility and
determines the frequency that supports adequate
security for the entity, and the level of risk the
entity is willing to accept.
The risk analysis identifies the specific assets,
such as the system components and data—for
example, log files, or credentials—that the
requirement is intended to protect, as well as the
threat(s) or outcomes that the requirement is
protecting the assets from—for example,
malware, an undetected intruder, or misuse of
credentials. Examples of factors that could
contribute to likelihood or impact include any that
could increase the vulnerability of an asset to a
threat—for example, exposure to untrusted
networks, complexity of environment, or high staff
turnover—as well as the criticality of the system
components, or volume and sensitivity of the
data, being protected.
(continued on next page)
```
```
12.3.1 Each PCI DSS requirement that provides
flexibility for how frequently it is performed (for
example, requirements to be performed periodically)
is supported by a targeted risk analysis that is
documented and includes:
```
- Identification of the assets being protected.
- Identification of the threat(s) that the requirement
    is protecting against.
- Identification of factors that contribute to the
    likelihood and/or impact of a threat being
    realized.
- Resulting analysis that determines, and includes
    justification for, how frequently the requirement
    must be performed to minimize the likelihood of
    the threat being realized.
- Review of each targeted risk analysis at least
    once every 12 months to determine whether the
    results are still valid or if an updated risk analysis
    is needed.
- Performance of updated risk analyses when
    needed, as determined by the annual review.

```
12.3.1 Examine documented policies and
procedures to verify a process is defined for
performing targeted risk analyses for each PCI
DSS requirement that provides flexibility for how
frequently the requirement is performed, and that
the process includes all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Up to date knowledge and assessment of risks to
the CDE are maintained.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Reviewing the results of these targeted risk
analyses at least once every 12 months and upon
changes that could impact the risk to the
environment allows the organization to ensure the
risk analysis results remain current with
organizational changes and evolving threats,
trends, and technologies, and that the selected
frequencies still adequately address the entity’s
risk.
Good Practice
An enterprise-wide risk assessment, which is a
point-in-time activity that enables entities to
identify threats and associated vulnerabilities, is
recommended, but is not required, for entities to
determine and understand broader and emerging
threats with the potential to negatively impact its
business. This enterprise-wide risk assessment
could be established as part of an overarching
risk management program that is used as an
input to the annual review of an organization's
overall information security policy (see
Requirement 12.1.1).
Examples of risk-assessment methodologies for
enterprise-wide risk assessments include, but are
not limited to, ISO 27005 and NIST SP 800-30.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
A risk analysis following a repeatable and robust
methodology enables an entity to meet the
customized approach objective.
Definitions
The customized approach to meeting a PCI DSS
requirement allows entities to define the controls
used to meet a given requirement’s stated
Customized Approach Objective in a way that
does not strictly follow the defined requirement.
These controls are expected to at least meet or
exceed the security provided by the defined
requirement and require extensive documentation
by the entity using the customized approach.
Further Information
See Appendix D: Customized Approach for
instructions on how to document the required
evidence for the customized approach.
See Appendix E Sample Templates to Support
Customized Approach for templates that entities
may use to document their customized controls.
Note that while use of the templates is optional,
the information specified within each template
must be documented and provided to each
entity’s assessor.
```
```
12.3.2 A targeted risk analysis is performed for each
PCI DSS requirement that the entity meets with the
customized approach, to include:
```
- Documented evidence detailing each element
    specified in Appendix D: Customized Approach
    (including, at a minimum, a controls matrix and
    risk analysis).
- Approval of documented evidence by senior
    management.
- Performance of the targeted analysis of risk at
    least once every 12 months.

```
12.3.2 Examine the documented targeted risk-
analysis for each PCI DSS requirement that the
entity meets with the customized approach to verify
that documentation for each requirement exists
and is in accordance with all elements specified in
this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
This requirement is part of the customized approach
and must be met for those using the customized
approach.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement only applies to entities using a
Customized Approach.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Protocols and encryption strengths may quickly
change or be deprecated due to identification of
vulnerabilities or design flaws. In order to support
current and future data security needs, entities
need to know where cryptography is used and
understand how they would be able to respond
rapidly to changes impacting the strength of their
cryptographic implementations.
Good Practice
Cryptographic agility is important to ensure an
alternative to the original encryption method or
cryptographic primitive is available, with plans to
upgrade to the alternative without significant
change to system infrastructure. For example, if
the entity is aware of when protocols or
algorithms will be deprecated by standards
bodies, it can make proactive plans to upgrade
before the deprecation is impactful to operations.
Definitions
“Cryptographic agility” refers to the ability to
monitor and manage the encryption and related
verification technologies deployed across an
organization.
Further Information
Refer to NIST SP 800-131a, Transitioning the
Use of Cryptographic Algorithms and Key
Lengths.
```
```
12.3.3 Cryptographic cipher suites and protocols in
use are documented and reviewed at least once
every 12 months, including at least the following:
```
- An up-to-date inventory of all cryptographic
    cipher suites and protocols in use, including
    purpose and where used.
- Active monitoring of industry trends regarding
    continued viability of all cryptographic cipher
    suites and protocols in use.
- A documented strategy to respond to anticipated
    changes in cryptographic vulnerabilities.

```
12.3.3 Examine documentation for cryptographic
suites and protocols in use and interview personnel
to verify the documentation and review is in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The entity is able to respond quickly to any
vulnerabilities in cryptographic protocols or
algorithms, where those vulnerabilities affect
protection of cardholder data.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
The requirement applies to all cryptographic suites
and protocols used to meet PCI DSS requirements.
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Hardware and software technologies are
constantly evolving, and organizations need to be
aware of changes to the technologies they use,
as well as the evolving threats to those
technologies to ensure that they can prepare for,
and manage, vulnerabilities in hardware and
software that will not be remediated by the vendor
or developer.
Good Practice
Organizations should review firmware versions to
ensure they remain current and supported by the
vendors. Organizations also need to be aware of
changes made by technology vendors to their
products or processes to understand how such
changes may impact the organization’s use of the
technology.
Regular reviews of technologies that impact or
influence PCI DSS controls can assist with
purchasing, usage, and deployment strategies,
and ensure controls that rely on those
technologies remain effective. These reviews
include, but are not limited to, reviewing
technologies that are no longer supported by the
vendor and/or no longer meet the security needs
of the organization.
```
```
12.3.4 Hardware and software technologies in use
are reviewed at least once every 12 months,
including at least the following:
```
- Analysis that the technologies continue to
    receive security fixes from vendors promptly.
- Analysis that the technologies continue to
    support (and do not preclude) the entity’s PCI
    DSS compliance.
- Documentation of any industry announcements
    or trends related to a technology, such as when
    a vendor has announced “end of life” plans for a
    technology.
- Documentation of a plan, approved by senior
    management, to remediate outdated
    technologies, including those for which vendors
    have announced “end of life” plans.

```
12.3.4 Examine documentation for the review of
hardware and software technologies in use and
interview personnel to verify that the review is in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The entity’s hardware and software technologies are
up to date and supported by the vendor. Plans to
remove or replace all unsupported system
components are reviewed periodically.

executive management for the protection of
cardholder data and a PCI DSS compliance
program to include:
```
- Overall accountability for maintaining PCI DSS
    compliance.
- Defining a charter for a PCI DSS compliance
    program and communication to executive
    management.

```
12.4.1 Additional testing procedure for service

This requirement applies only when the entity being
assessed is a service provider.
Executive management may include C-level
positions, board of directors, or equivalent. The
specific titles will depend on the particular
organizational structure.
Responsibility for the PCI DSS compliance program
may be assigned to individual roles and/or to
business units within the organization.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Regularly confirming that security policies and
procedures are being followed provides
assurance that the expected controls are active
and working as intended. This requirement is
distinct from other requirements that specify a
task to be performed. The objective of these
reviews is not to reperform other PCI DSS
requirements, but to confirm that security
activities are being performed on an ongoing
basis.
Good Practice
These reviews can also be used to verify that
appropriate evidence is being maintained—for
example, audit logs, vulnerability scan reports,
reviews of network security control rulesets—to
assist in the entity’s preparation for its next PCI
DSS assessment.
Examples
Looking at Requirement 1.2.7 as one example,
Requirement 12.4.2 is met by confirming, at least
once every three months, that reviews of
configurations of network security controls have
occurred at the required frequency. On the other
hand, Requirement 1.2.7 is met by reviewing
those configurations as specified in the
requirement.
```
```
12.4.2 Additional requirement for service
providers only: Reviews are performed at least
once every three months to confirm that personnel
are performing their tasks in accordance with all
security policies and operational procedures.
Reviews are performed by personnel other than
those responsible for performing the given task and
include, but are not limited to, the following tasks:
```
- Daily log reviews.
- Configuration reviews for network security
    controls.
- Applying configuration standards to new
    systems.
- Responding to security alerts.
- Change-management processes.

```
12.4.2.a Additional testing procedure for
service provider assessments only: Examine
policies and procedures to verify that processes
are defined for conducting reviews to confirm that
personnel are performing their tasks in accordance
with all security policies and all operational
procedures, including but not limited to the tasks
specified in this requirement.
```
```
12.4.2.b Additional testing procedure for
service provider assessments only: Interview
responsible personnel and examine records of
reviews to verify that reviews are performed:
```
- At least once every three months.
- By personnel other than those responsible for
    performing the given task.

```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The operational effectiveness of critical PCI DSS
controls is verified periodically by manual inspection
of records.

network security control rulesets—to assist in the
entity’s preparation for its next PCI DSS
assessment.
```
```
12.4.2.1 Additional requirement for service

12.5 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Maintaining a current list of all system
components will enable an organization to define
the scope of its environment and implement PCI
DSS requirements accurately and efficiently.
Without an inventory, some system components
could be overlooked and be inadvertently
excluded from the organization’s configuration
standards.
Good Practice
If an entity keeps an inventory of all assets, those
system components in scope for PCI DSS should
be clearly identifiable among the other assets.
Inventories should include containers or images
that may be instantiated.
Assigning an owner to the inventory helps to
ensure the inventory stays current.
Examples
Methods to maintain an inventory include as a
database, as a series of files, or in an inventory-
management tool.
```
```
12.5.1 An inventory of system components that are
in scope for PCI DSS, including a description of
function/use, is maintained and kept current.
```
```
12.5.1.a Examine the inventory to verify it includes
all in-scope system components and a description
of function/use for each.
```
```
12.5.1.b Interview personnel to verify the inventory
is kept current.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
All system components in scope for PCI DSS are
identified and known.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Frequent validation of PCI DSS scope helps to
ensure PCI DSS scope remains up to date and
aligned with changing business objectives, and
therefore that security controls are protecting all
appropriate system components.
Good Practice
Accurate scoping involves critically evaluating the
CDE and all connected system components to
determine the necessary coverage for PCI DSS
requirements. Scoping activities, including careful
analysis and ongoing monitoring, help to ensure
that in-scope systems are appropriately secured.
When documenting account data locations, the
entity can consider creating a table or
spreadsheet that includes the following
information:

12.5.2 PCI DSS scope is documented and
confirmed by the entity at least once every 12
months and upon significant change to the in-scope
environment. At a minimum, the scoping validation
includes:
```
- Identifying all data flows for the various payment
    stages (for example, authorization, capture
    settlement, chargebacks, and refunds) and
    acceptance channels (for example, card-present,
    card-not-present, and e-commerce).
- Updating all data-flow diagrams per
    Requirement 1.2.4.
- Identifying all locations where account data is
    stored, processed, and transmitted, including but
    not limited to: 1) any locations outside of the
    currently defined CDE, 2) applications that
    process CHD, 3) transmissions between
    systems and networks, and 4) file backups.
- Identifying all system components in the CDE,
    connected to the CDE, or that could impact
    security of the CDE.
- Identifying all segmentation controls in use and
    the environment(s) from which the CDE is
    segmented, including justification for
    environments being out of scope.
- Identifying all connections from third-party
    entities with access to the CDE.
- Confirming that all identified data flows, account
    data, system components, segmentation
    controls, and connections from third parties with
    access to the CDE are included in scope.

12.5.2.a Examine documented results of scope
reviews and interview personnel to verify that the
reviews are performed:
```
- At least once every 12 months.
- After significant changes to the in-scope

```
12.5.2.b Examine documented results of scope
reviews performed by the entity to verify that PCI
DSS scoping confirmation activity includes all
elements specified in this requirement.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Customized Approach Objective^ In addition to internal systems and networks, all
connections from third-party entities—for
example, business partners, entities providing
remote support services, and other service
providers—need to be identified to determine
inclusion for PCI DSS scope. Once the in-scope
connections have been identified, the applicable
PCI DSS controls can be implemented to reduce
the risk of a third-party connection being used to
compromise an entity’s CDE.
A data discovery tool or methodology can be used
to facilitate identifying all sources and locations of
PAN, and to look for PAN that resides on systems
and networks outside the currently defined CDE
or in unexpected places within the defined CDE—
for example, in an error log or memory dump file.
This approach can help ensure that previously
unknown locations of PAN are detected and that
the PAN is either eliminated or properly secured.

This annual confirmation of PCI DSS scope is an
activity expected to be performed by the entity

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Service providers typically have access to greater
volumes of cardholder data than do merchants, or
can provide an entry point that can be exploited to
then compromise multiple other entities. Service
providers also typically have larger and more
complex networks that are subject to more
frequent change. The probability of overlooked
changes to scope in complex and dynamic
networks is greater in service providers’
environments.
Validating PCI DSS scope more frequently is
likely to discover such overlooked changes before
they can be exploited by an attacker.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
An organization’s structure and management
define the requirements and protocol for effective
and secure operations. Changes to this structure
could have negative effects to existing controls
and frameworks by reallocating or removing
resources that once supported PCI DSS controls
or inheriting new responsibilities that may not
have established controls in place. Therefore, it is
important to revisit PCI DSS scope and controls
when there are changes to an organization’s
structure and management to ensure controls are
in place and active.
Examples
Changes to organizational structure include, but
are not limited to, company mergers or
acquisitions, and significant changes or
reassignments of personnel with responsibility for
security controls.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Training of personnel ensures they receive the
information about the importance of information
security and that they understand their role in
protecting the organization.
Requiring an acknowledgment by personnel helps
ensure that they have read and understood the
security policies and procedures, and that they
have made and will continue to make a
commitment to comply with these policies.
Good Practice
Entities may incorporate new-hire training as part
of the Human Resources onboarding process.
Training should outline the security-related “dos”
and “don’ts.” Periodic refresher training reinforces
key security processes and procedures that may
be forgotten or bypassed.
Entities should consider requiring security
awareness training anytime personnel transfer
into roles where they can impact the security of
account data from roles where they did not have
this impact.
Methods and training content can vary, depending
on personnel roles.
Examples
Different methods that can be used to provide
security awareness and education include
posters, letters, web-based training, in-person
training, team meetings, and incentives.
Personnel acknowledgments may be recorded in
writing or electronically.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Educating personnel on how to detect, react to,
and report potential phishing and related attacks
and social engineering attempts is essential to
minimizing the probability of successful attacks.
Good Practice
An effective security awareness program should
include examples of phishing emails and periodic
testing to determine the prevalence of personnel
reporting such attacks. Training material an entity
can consider for this topic include:
```
- How to identify phishing and other social
    engineering attacks.
- How to react to suspected phishing and social
    engineering.
- Where and how to report suspected phishing
    and social engineering activity.
An emphasis on reporting allows the organization
to reward positive behavior, to optimize technical
defenses (see Requirement 5.4.1), and to take
immediate action to remove similar phishing
emails that evaded technical defenses from
recipient inboxes.

```
12.6.3.1 Security awareness training includes
awareness of threats and vulnerabilities that could
impact the security of the CDE, including but not
limited to:

12.7 Personnel are screened to reduce risks from insider threats.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Performing thorough screening prior to hiring
potential personnel who are expected to be given
access to the CDE provides entities with the
information necessary to make informed risk
decisions regarding personnel they hire that will
have access to the CDE.
Other benefits of screening potential personnel
include helping to ensure workplace safety and
confirming information provided by prospective
employees on their resumes.
Good Practice
Entities should consider screening for existing
personnel anytime they transfer into roles where
they have access to the CDE from roles where
they did not have this access.
To be effective, the level of screening should be
appropriate for the position. For example,
positions requiring greater responsibility or that
have administrative access to critical data or
systems may warrant more detailed or more
frequent screening than positions with less
responsibility and access.
Examples
Screening options can include, as appropriate for
the entity’s region, previous employment history,
review of public information/social media
resources, criminal record, credit history, and
reference checks.
```

    services, anti-malware services, and security
    incident and event management (SIEM);
    contact and call centers; web-hosting
    companies; and IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and

make an entity PCI DSS compliant, nor does it
remove the entity’s responsibility for its own PCI
DSS compliance.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The written acknowledgment from a TPSP
demonstrates its commitment to maintaining
proper security of account data that it obtains
from its customers and that the TPSP is fully
aware of the assets that could be affected during
the provisioning of the TPSP’s service. The extent
to which a specific TPSP is responsible for the
security of account data will depend on the
service provided and the agreement between the
provider and assessed entity (the customer).
In conjunction with Requirement 12.9.1, this
requirement is intended to promote a consistent
level of understanding between parties about their
applicable PCI DSS responsibilities. For example,
the agreement may include the applicable PCI
DSS requirements to be maintained as part of the
provided service.
Good Practice
The entity may also want to consider including in
their written agreement with a TPSP that the
TPSP will support the entity’s request for
information per Requirement 12.9.2. Entities will
also want to understand whether any TPSPs have
“nested” relationships with other TPSPs, meaning
the primary TPSP contracts with another TPSP(s)
for the purposes of providing a service.
It is important to understand whether the primary
TPSP is relying on the secondary TPSP(s) to
achieve overall compliance of a service, and what
types of written agreements the primary TPSP
has in place with the secondary TPSPs. Entities
can consider including coverage in their written
agreement for any “nested” TPSPs a primary
TPSP may use.

acknowledgment does not have to include the exact
wording provided in this requirement.
Evidence that a TPSP is meeting PCI DSS

engagement, helps ensure that a TPSP is
thoroughly vetted internally by an entity prior to
establishing a formal relationship and that the risk
to cardholder data associated with the
engagement of the TPSP is understood.
Good Practice
Specific due-diligence processes and goals will
vary for each organization. Elements that should
be considered include the provider’s reporting

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Knowing the PCI DSS compliance status of all
engaged TPSPs provides assurance and
awareness about whether they comply with the
requirements applicable to the services they offer
to the organization.
Good Practice
If the TPSP offers a variety of services, the
compliance status the entity monitors should be
specific to those services delivered to the entity
and those services in scope for the entity’s PCI
DSS assessment.
If a TPSP has a PCI DSS Attestation of
Compliance (AOC), the expectation is that the
TPSP should provide that to customers upon
request to demonstrate their PCI DSS compliance
status.
If the TPSP did not undergo a PCI DSS
assessment, it may be able to provide other
sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it has met
the applicable requirements without undergoing a
formal compliance validation. For example, the
TPSP can provide specific evidence to the entity’s
assessor so the assessor can confirm applicable
requirements are met. Alternatively, the TPSP
can elect to undergo multiple on-demand
assessments by each of its customers’ assessors,
with each assessment targeted to confirm that
applicable requirements are met.

**Applicability Notes**
Where an entity has an agreement with a TPSP for
meeting PCI DSS requirements on behalf of the
entity (for example, via a firewall service), the entity
must work with the TPSP to make sure the
applicable PCI DSS requirements are met. If the
TPSP does not meet those applicable PCI DSS
requirements, then those requirements are also “not
in place” for the entity.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
It is important that the entity understands which
PCI DSS requirements and sub-requirements its
TPSPs have agreed to meet, which requirements
are shared between the TPSP and the entity, and
for those that are shared, specifics about how the
requirements are shared and which entity is
responsible for meeting each sub-requirement.
Without this shared understanding, it is inevitable
that the entity and the TPSP will assume a given
PCI DSS sub-requirement is the responsibility of
the other party, and therefore that sub-
requirement may not be addressed at all.
The specific information an entity maintains will
depend on the particular agreement with their
providers, the type of service, etc. TPSPs may
define their PCI DSS responsibilities to be the
same for all their customers; otherwise, this
responsibility should be agreed upon by both the
entity and TPSP.
Good Practice
Entities can document these responsibilities via a
matrix that identifies all applicable PCI DSS
requirements and indicates for each requirement

It is also important for entities to understand
whether any TPSPs have “nested” relationships
with other TPSPs, meaning the primary TPSP
contracts with another TPSP(s) for the purposes
of providing a service. It is important to
understand whether the primary TPSP is relying
on the secondary TPSP(s) to achieve overall
compliance of a service, and how the primary
TPSP is monitoring performance of the service
and the PCI DSS compliance status of the
secondary TPSP(s). Note that it is the
responsibility of the primary TPSP to manage and
monitor any secondary TPSPs.

12.9 Third-party service providers (TPSPs) support their customers’ PCI DSS compliance.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
In conjunction with Requirement 12.8.2, this
requirement is intended to promote a consistent
level of understanding between TPSPs and their
customers about their applicable PCI DSS
responsibilities. The acknowledgment of the
TPSPs evidences their commitment to
maintaining proper security of account data that it
obtains from its clients.
The method by which the TPSP provides written
acknowledgment should be agreed between the
provider and its customers.
```
```
12.9.1 Additional requirement for service
providers only: TPSPs acknowledge in writing to
customers that they are responsible for the security
of account data the TPSP possesses or otherwise
stores, processes, or transmits on behalf of the
customer, or to the extent that they could impact the
security of the customer’s CDE.
```
```
12.9.1 Additional testing procedure for service
provider assessments only: Examine TPSP
policies, procedures, and templates used for
written agreements to verify processes are defined
for the TPSP to provide written acknowledgments
to customers in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
TPSPs formally acknowledge their security
responsibilities to their customers.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement applies only when the entity being
assessed is a service provider.
The exact wording of an acknowledgment will
depend on the agreement between the two parties,
the details of the service being provided, and the
responsibilities assigned to each party. The
acknowledgment does not have to include the exact
wording provided in this requirement.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If a TPSP does not provide the necessary
information to enable its customers to meet their
security and compliance requirements, the
customers will not be able to protect cardholder
data nor meet their own contractual obligations.
Good Practice
If a TPSP has a PCI DSS Attestation of
Compliance (AOC), the expectation is that the
TPSP should provide that to customers upon
request to demonstrate their PCI DSS compliance
status.
If the TPSP did not undergo a PCI DSS
assessment, they may be able to provide other
sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it has met
the applicable requirements without undergoing a
formal compliance validation. For example, the
TPSP can provide specific evidence to the entity’s
assessor so the assessor can confirm applicable
requirements are met. Alternatively, the TPSP
can elect to undergo multiple on-demand
assessments by each of its customers’ assessors,
with each assessment targeted to confirm that
applicable requirements are met.
TPSPs should provide sufficient evidence to their
customers to verify that the scope of the TPSP’s
PCI DSS assessment covered the services
applicable to the customer and that the relevant
PCI DSS requirements were examined and
determined to be in place.
(continued on next page)
```
```
12.9.2 Additional requirement for service
providers only: TPSPs support their customers’
requests for information to meet Requirements
12.8.4 and 12.8.5 by providing the following upon
customer request:
```
- PCI DSS compliance status information for any
    service the TPSP performs on behalf of
    customers (Requirement 12.8.4).
- Information about which PCI DSS requirements
    are the responsibility of the TPSP and which are
    the responsibility of the customer, including any
    shared responsibilities (Requirement 12.8.5).

```
12.9.2 Additional testing procedure for service
provider assessments only: Examine policies
and procedures to verify processes are defined for
the TPSPs to support customers’ request for
information to meet Requirements 12.8.4 and
12.8.5 in accordance with all elements specified in
this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
TPSPs provide information as needed to support
their customers’ PCI DSS compliance efforts.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement applies only when the entity being
assessed is a service provider.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
TPSPs may define their PCI DSS responsibilities
to be the same for all their customers; otherwise,
this responsibility should be agreed upon by both
the customer and TPSP. It is important that the
customer understands which PCI DSS
requirements and sub-requirements its TPSPs
have agreed to meet, which requirements are
shared between the TPSP and the customer, and
for those that are shared, specifics about how the
requirements are shared and which entity is
responsible for meeting each sub-requirement. An
example of a way to document these
responsibilities is via a matrix that identifies all
applicable PCI DSS requirements and indicates
whether the customer or TPSP is responsible for
meeting that requirement or whether it is a shared
responsibility.

12.10 Suspected and confirmed security incidents that could impact the CDE are responded to immediately.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without a comprehensive incident response plan
that is properly disseminated, read, and
understood by the parties responsible, confusion
and lack of a unified response could create further
downtime for the business, unnecessary public
media exposure, as well as risk of financial and/or
reputational loss and legal liabilities.
Good Practice
The incident response plan should be thorough
and contain all the key elements for stakeholders
(for example, legal, communications) to allow the
entity to respond effectively in the event of a
breach that could impact account data. It is
important to keep the plan up to date with current
contact information of all individuals designated
as having a role in incident response. Other
relevant parties for notifications may include
customers, financial institutions (acquirers and
issuers), and business partners.
Entities should consider how to address all
compromises of data within the CDE in their
incident response plans, including to account
data, wireless encryption keys, encryption keys
used for transmission and storage or account
data or cardholder data, etc.
Examples
Legal requirements for reporting compromises
include those in most US states, the EU General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the
Personal Data Protection Act (Singapore).

For more information, refer to the NIST SP 800-
61 Rev. 2, Computer Security Incident Handling
Guide.

```
12.10.1 An incident response plan exists and is
ready to be activated in the event of a suspected or
confirmed security incident. The plan includes, but is
not limited to:
```
- Roles, responsibilities, and communication and
    contact strategies in the event of a suspected or
    confirmed security incident, including notification
    of payment brands and acquirers, at a minimum.
- Incident response procedures with specific
    containment and mitigation activities for different
    types of incidents.
- Business recovery and continuity procedures.
- Data backup processes.
- Analysis of legal requirements for reporting
    compromises.
- Coverage and responses of all critical system
    components.
- Reference or inclusion of incident response
    procedures from the payment brands.

```
12.10.1.a Examine the incident response plan to
verify that the plan exists and includes at least the
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
12.10.1.b Interview personnel and examine
documentation from previously reported incidents
or alerts to verify that the documented incident
response plan and procedures were followed.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
A comprehensive incident response plan that meets
card brand expectations is maintained.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Proper testing of the security incident response
plan can identify broken business processes and
ensure key steps are not missed, which could
result in increased exposure during an incident.
Periodic testing of the plan ensures that the
processes remain viable, as well as ensuring that
all relevant personnel in the organization are
familiar with the plan.
Good Practice
The test of the incident response plan can include
simulated incidents and the corresponding
responses in the form of a “table-top exercise”,
that include participation by relevant personnel. A
review of the incident and the quality of the
response can provide entities with the assurance
that all required elements are included in the plan.
```
```
12.10.2 At least once every 12 months, the security
incident response plan is:
```
- Reviewed and the content is updated as needed.
- Tested, including all elements listed in
    Requirement 12.10.1.

```
12.10.2 Interview personnel and review
documentation to verify that, at least once every 12
months, the security incident response plan is:
```
- Reviewed and updated as needed.
- Tested, including all elements listed in
    Requirement 12.10.1.
**Customized Approach Objective**

```
The incident response plan is kept current and
tested periodically.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
An incident could occur at any time, therefore if a
person who is trained in incident response and
familiar with the entity’s plan is available when an
incident is detected, the entity’s ability to correctly
respond to the incident is increased.
Good Practice
Often, specific personnel are designated to be
part of a security incident response team, with the
team having overall responsibility for responding
to incidents (perhaps on a rotating schedule
basis) and managing those incidents in
accordance with the plan. The incident response
team can consist of core members who are
permanently assigned or “on-demand” personnel
who may be called up as necessary, depending
on their expertise and the specifics of the incident.
Having available resources to respond quickly to
incidents minimizes disruption to the organization.
Examples of types of activity the team or
individuals should respond to include any
evidence of unauthorized activity, detection of
unauthorized wireless access points, critical IDS
alerts, and reports of unauthorized critical system
or content file changes.

Without a trained and readily available incident
response team, extended damage to the network
could occur, and critical data and systems may
become “polluted” by inappropriate handling of
the targeted systems. This can hinder the
success of a post-incident investigation.
Good Practice
It is important that all personnel involved in
incident response are trained and knowledgeable
about managing evidence for forensics and
investigations.

Performing a risk analysis will allow the entity to
determine the optimum frequency for training
personnel with incident response responsibilities.
```

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Incorporating lessons learned into the incident
response plan after an incident occurs and in-step
with industry developments, helps keep the plan
current and able to react to emerging threats and
security trends.
Good Practice
The lessons-learned exercise should include all
levels of personnel. Although it is often included
as part of the review of the entire incident, it
should focus on how the entity’s response to the
incident could be improved.
It is important to not just consider elements of the
response that did not have the planned outcomes
but also to understand what worked well and
whether lessons from those elements that worked
well can be applied areas of the plan that didn’t.
Another way to optimize an entity’s incident

against other organizations and use that
information to fine-tune the entity’s detection,

Having documented incident response
procedures that are followed in the event that
stored PAN is found anywhere it is not expected
to be, helps to identify the necessary remediation
actions and prevent future leaks.
Good Practice
If PAN was found outside the CDE, analysis
should be performed to 1) determine whether it
was saved independently of other data or with
sensitive authentication data, 2) identify the
source of the data, and 3) identify the control
gaps that resulted in the data being outside the
CDE.
Entities should consider whether there are
contributory factors, such as business processes,
user behavior, improper system configurations,
etc. that caused the PAN to be stored in an
unexpected location. If such contributory factors
are present, they should be addressed per this
Requirement to prevent recurrence.
```

```
- Determining what to do if PAN is discovered
    outside the CDE, including its retrieval, secure
    deletion, and/or migration into the currently
    defined CDE, as applicable.
- Identifying whether sensitive authentication data
    is stored with PAN.
- Determining where the account data came from
    and how it ended up where it was not expected.
- Remediating data leaks or process gaps that

```
```
 Appendix A2: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Entities Using SSL/early TLS for Card-Present POS POI Terminal Connections

### Appendix A1: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Multi-Tenant Service Providers

```
Sections
```
```
A1.1 Multi-tenant service providers protect and separate all customer environments and data.
A1.2 Multi-tenant service providers facilitate logging and incident response for all customers.
```
```
Overview
```
```
All service providers are responsible for meeting PCI DSS requirements for their own environments as applicable to the services offered to their customers. In
addition, multi-tenant service providers must meet the requirements in this Appendix.
Multi-tenant service providers are a type of third-party service provider that offers various shared services to merchants and other service providers, where
customers share system resources (such as physical or virtual servers), infrastructure, applications (including Software as a Service (SaaS)), and/or databases.
Services may include, but are not limited to, hosting multiple entities on a single shared server, providing e-commerce and/or “shopping cart” services, web-
based hosting services, payment applications, various cloud applications and services, and connections to payment gateways and processors.
Service providers that provide only shared data center services (often called co-location or “co-lo” providers), where equipment, space, and bandwidth are
available on a rental basis, are not considered multi-tenant service providers for purposes of this Appendix.
Note : Even though a multi-tenant service provider may meet these requirements, each customer is still responsible to comply with the PCI DSS requirements
that are applicable to its environment and validate compliance as applicable. Often, there are PCI DSS requirements for which responsibility is shared between
the provider and the customer (for perhaps different aspects of the environment). Requirements 12.8 and 12.9 delineate requirements specific to the
relationships between all third-party service providers (TPSPs) and their customers, and the responsibilities of both. This includes defining the specific services
the customer is receiving, along with which PCI DSS requirements are the responsibility of the customer to meet, which are the responsibility of the TPSP, and
which requirements are shared between both customer and the TPSP.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
A1.1 Multi-tenant service providers protect and separate all customer environments and data.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without controls between the provider’s environment
and the customer’s environment, a malicious actor
within the provider’s environment could compromise
the customer’s environment, and similarly, a
malicious actor in a customer environment could
compromise the provider and potentially other of the
provider’s customers.
Multi-tenant environments should be isolated from
each other and from the provider’s infrastructure
such that they can be separately managed entities
with no connectivity between them.
Good Practice
Providers should ensure strong separation between
the environments that are designed for customer
access, for example, configuration and billing portals,
and the provider’s private environment that should
only be accessed by authorized provider personnel.
Service provider access to customer environments is
performed in accordance with requirement 8.2.3.
Further Information
Refer to the Information Supplement: PCI SSC Cloud
Computing Guidelines for further guidance on cloud
environments.
```
```
A1.1.1 Logical separation is implemented as
follows:
```
- The provider cannot access its customers’
    environments without authorization.
- Customers cannot access the provider’s
    environment without authorization.

```
A1.1.1 Examine documentation and system and
network configurations and interview personnel to
verify that logical separation is implemented in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```

```
```
Customers cannot access the provider’s
environment. The provider cannot access its
customers’ environments without authorization.
```

March 2025, after which it will be required and
must be fully considered during a PCI DSS
assessment.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
It is important that a multi-tenant service provider
define controls so that each customer can only
access their own environment and CDE to prevent
unauthorized access from one customer’s
environment to another.
Examples
In a cloud-based infrastructure, such as an
infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offering, the
customers’ CDE may include virtual network devices
and virtual servers that are configured and managed
by the customers, including operating systems, files,
memory, etc.
```
```
A1.1.2 Controls are implemented such that each
customer only has permission to access its own
cardholder data and CDE.
```
```
A1.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify controls
are defined such that each customer only has
permission to access its own cardholder data and
CDE.
```
```
A1.1.2.b Examine system configurations to verify
that customers have privileges established to only
Customized Approach Objective access their own account data and CDE.^
```
```
Customers cannot access other customers’
environments.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
To prevent any inadvertent or intentional impact to
other customers’ environments or account data, it is
important that each customer can access only
resources allocated to that customer.
```
```
A1.1.3 Controls are implemented such that each
customer can only access resources allocated to
them.
```
```
A1.1.3 Examine customer privileges to verify each
customer can only access resources allocated to
them.

Customers cannot impact resources allocated to
other customers.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Multi-tenant services providers are responsible for
managing the segmentation between their
customers.
Without technical assurance that segmentation
controls are effective, it is possible that changes to
the service provider’s technology would inadvertently
create a vulnerability that could be exploited across
all the service provider’s customers.
Good Practice
Effectiveness of separation techniques can be
confirmed by using service-provider-created
temporary (mock-up) environments that represent
customer environments and attempting to 1) access
one temporary environment from another
environment, and 2) access a temporary environment
from the Internet.
```
```
A1.1.4 The effectiveness of logical separation
controls used to separate customer
environments is confirmed at least once every
six months via penetration testing.
```
```
A1.1.4 Examine the results from the most recent
penetration test to verify that testing confirmed the
effectiveness of logical separation controls used to

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Log information is useful for detecting and
troubleshooting security incidents and is invaluable
for forensic investigations. Customers therefore need
to have access to these logs.
However, log information can also be used by an
attacker for reconnaissance, and so a customer’s log
information must only be accessible by the customer
that the log relates to.
```
```
A1.2.1 Audit log capability is enabled for each
customer’s environment that is consistent with
PCI DSS Requirement 10, including:
```
- Logs are enabled for common third-party
    applications.
- Logs are active by default.
- Logs are available for review only by the
    owning customer.
- Log locations are clearly communicated to
    the owning customer.
- Log data and availability is consistent with
    PCI DSS Requirement 10.

```

Log capability is available to all customers
without affecting the confidentiality of other
customers.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
In the event of a suspected or confirmed breach of
confidentiality of cardholder data, a customer’s
forensic investigator aims to find the cause of the
breach, exclude the attacker from the environment,
and ensure all unauthorized access is removed.
Prompt and efficient responses to forensic
investigators’ requests can significantly reduce the
time taken for the investigator to secure the
customer’s environment.

### Appendix A2: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Entities Using SSL/Early TLS for Card-Present POS POI Terminal Connections

```
Sections
```
```
A2.1 POI terminals using SSL and/or early TLS are confirmed as not susceptible to known SSL/TLS exploits.
```
```
Overview
```
```
This Appendix applies only to entities using SSL/early TLS as a security control to protect POS POI terminals, including service providers that
provide connections into POS POI terminals.
```
```
Entities using SSL and early TLS for POS POI terminal connections must work toward upgrading to a strong cryptographic protocol as soon as
possible. Additionally, SSL and/or early TLS must not be introduced into environments where those protocols don’t already exist. At the time of
publication, the known vulnerabilities are difficult to exploit in POS POI payment terminals. However, new vulnerabilities could emerge at any
time, and it is up to the organization to remain up to date with vulnerability trends and determine whether it is susceptible to any known exploits.
```
```
The PCI DSS requirements directly affected are:
```
- **Requirement 2.2.5** : Where any insecure services, protocols, or daemons are present; business justification is documented, and additional
    security features are documented and implemented that reduce the risk of using insecure services, protocols, or daemons.
- **Requirement 2.2.7** : All non-console administrative access is encrypted using strong cryptography.
- **Requirement 4.2.1** : Strong cryptography and security protocols are implemented to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public
    networks.

```
SSL and early TLS must not be used as a security control to meet these requirements, except in the case of POS POI terminal connections, as
detailed in this appendix. To support entities working to migrate from SSL/early TLS on POS POI terminals, the following provisions are
included:
```
- New POS POI terminal implementations must not use SSL or early TLS as a security control.
- All POS POI terminal service providers must provide a secure service offering.
- Service providers supporting existing POS POI terminal implementations that use SSL and/or early TLS must have a formal Risk Mitigation
    and Migration Plan in place.
- POS POI terminals in card-present environments that can be verified as not being susceptible to any known exploits for SSL and early TLS,
    **and the SSL/TLS termination points to which they connect** , may continue using SSL/early TLS as a security control.

```
Requirements in this Appendix are not eligible for the Customized Approach.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
A2.1 POI terminals using SSL and/or early TLS are confirmed as not susceptible to known SSL/TLS exploits.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
POS POI terminals used in card-present
environments can continue using SSL/early TLS
when it can be shown that the POS POI terminal
is not susceptible to the currently known exploits.
Good Practice
However, SSL is outdated technology and could
be susceptible to additional security vulnerabilities
in the future; it is therefore strongly recommended
that POS POI terminals be upgraded to a secure
protocol as soon as possible. If SSL/early TLS is
not needed in the environment, use of, and
fallback to these versions should be disabled.
Further Information
Refer to the current PCI SSC Information
Supplements on SSL/Early TLS for further
guidance.
```
```
A2.1.1 Where POS POI terminals at the merchant
or payment acceptance location use SSL and/or
early TLS, the entity confirms the devices are not
susceptible to any known exploits for those
protocols.
```
```
A2.1.1 For POS POI terminals using SSL and/or
early TLS, confirm the entity has documentation (for
example, vendor documentation, system/network
configuration details) that verifies the devices are not
susceptible to any known exploits for SSL/early TLS.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
This requirement is not eligible for the customized
approach.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is intended to apply to the entity
with the POS POI terminal, such as a merchant.
This requirement is not intended for service
providers who serve as the termination or
connection point to those POS POI terminals.
Requirements A2.1.2 and A2.1.3 apply to POS
POI service providers.
The allowance for POS POI terminals that are not
currently susceptible to exploits is based on
currently known risks. If new exploits are
introduced to which POS POI terminals are
susceptible, the POS POI terminals will need to be
updated immediately.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
POS POI termination points, including but not
limited to service providers such as acquirers or
acquirer processors, can continue using SSL/early
TLS when it can be shown that the service
provider has controls in place that mitigate the risk
of supporting those connections for the service
provider environment.
Good Practice
Service providers should communicate to all
customers using SSL/early TLS about the risks
associated with its use and the need to migrate to
a secure protocol.
Definitions
The Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan is a
document prepared by the entity that details its
plans for migrating to a secure protocol and
describes controls the entity has in place to
reduce the risk associated with SSL/early TLS
until the migration is complete.
Further Information
Refer to the current PCI SSC Information
Supplements on SSL/early TLS for further
guidance on Risk Mitigation and Migration Plans.
```
```
A2.1.2 Additional requirement for service
providers only: All service providers with existing
connection points to POS POI terminals that use
SSL and/or early TLS as defined in A2.1 have a
formal Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan in place
that includes:
```
- Description of usage, including what data is
    being transmitted, types and number of
    systems that use and/or support SSL/early
    TLS, and type of environment.
- Risk-assessment results and risk-reduction
    controls in place.
- Description of processes to monitor for new
    vulnerabilities associated with SSL/early TLS.
- Description of change control processes that
    are implemented to ensure SSL/early TLS is
    not implemented into new environments.
- Overview of migration project plan to replace
    SSL/early TLS at a future date.

```
A2.1.2 Additional testing procedure for service
provider assessments only: Review the
documented Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan to
verify it includes all elements specified in this
requirement.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Customers must be able to choose to upgrade
their POIs to eliminate the vulnerability in using
SSL and early TLS. In many cases, customers will
need to take a phased or gradual approach to
migrate their POS POI estate from the insecure
protocol to a secure protocol and so will require
the service provider to support a secure offering.

### Appendix A3: Designated Entities Supplemental Validation (DESV)

```
Sections
```
```
A3.1 A PCI DSS compliance program is implemented.
A3.2 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.
A3.3 PCI DSS is incorporated into business-as-usual (BAU) activities.
A3.4 Logical access to the cardholder data environment is controlled and managed.
A3.5 Suspicious events are identified and responded to.
```
```
Overview
```
```
This Appendix applies only to entities designated by a payment brand(s) or acquirer as requiring additional validation of existing PCI DSS
requirements. An entity is required to undergo an assessment according to this Appendix ONLY if instructed to do so by an acquirer or a
payment brand. Examples of entities that this Appendix could apply to include:
```
- Those storing, processing, and/or transmitting large volumes of account data,
- Those providing aggregation points for account data, or
- Those that have suffered significant or repeated breaches of account data.

```
Additionally, other PCI standards may reference completion of this Appendix.
```
```
These supplemental validation steps are intended to provide greater assurance that PCI DSS controls are maintained effectively and on a
continuous basis through validation of business-as-usual (BAU) processes and increased validation and scoping consideration.
```
```
Note : Some requirements have defined timeframes (for example, at least once every three months or at least once every six months) within
which certain activities are to be performed. For initial assessment to this document, it is not required that an activity has been performed for
every such timeframe during the previous year, if the assessor verifies:
```
- _The activity was performed in accordance with the applicable requirement within the most recent timeframe (for example, the most recent_
    _three-month or six-month period), and_
- _The entity has documented policies and procedures for continuing to perform the activity within the defined timeframe._

```
For subsequent years after the initial assessment, an activity must have been performed within each required timeframe (for example, an
activity required every three months must have been performed at least four times during the previous year at an interval that does not exceed
90 days).
```
```
Not all requirements in PCI DSS apply to all entities that may undergo a PCI DSS assessment. It is for this reason that some PCI DSS
Requirements are duplicated in this appendix. Any questions about this appendix should be addressed to acquirers or payment brands.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
A3.1 A PCI DSS compliance program is implemented.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Executive management assignment of PCI DSS
compliance responsibilities ensures executive-
level visibility into the PCI DSS compliance
program and allows for the opportunity to ask
appropriate questions to determine the
effectiveness of the program and influence
strategic priorities.
Good Practice
Executive management may include C-level
positions, board of directors, or equivalent. The
specific titles will depend on the particular
organizational structure.
Responsibility for the PCI DSS compliance
program may be assigned to individual roles
and/or to business units within the organization.
```
```
A3.1.1 Responsibility is established by executive
management for the protection of account data and
a PCI DSS compliance program that includes:
```
- Overall accountability for maintaining PCI DSS
    compliance.
- Defining a charter for a PCI DSS compliance
    program.
- Providing updates to executive management and
    board of directors on PCI DSS compliance
    initiatives and issues, including remediation
    activities, at least once every 12 months.
**PCI DSS Reference** : _Requirement 12_

```
A3.1.1.a Examine documentation to verify
executive management has assigned overall
accountability for maintaining the entity’s PCI DSS
compliance.
```
```
A3.1.1.b Examine the company’s PCI DSS charter
to verify it outlines the conditions under which the
PCI DSS compliance program is organized.
```
```
A3.1.1.c Examine executive management and
board of directors meeting minutes and/or
presentations to ensure PCI DSS compliance
initiatives and remediation activities are
communicated at least once every 12 months.

This requirement is not eligible for the customized
approach.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
A formal compliance program allows an
organization to monitor the health of its security
controls, be proactive if a control fails, and
effectively communicate activities and compliance
status throughout the organization.
Good Practice
The PCI DSS compliance program can be a
dedicated program or part of overarching
compliance and/or governance program, and
should include a well-defined methodology that
demonstrates consistent and effective evaluation.
Strategic business decisions that should be
analyzed for potential PCI DSS impacts may
include mergers and acquisitions, new technology
purchases, or new payment-acceptance
channels.
Definitions
Maintaining and monitoring an organization’s
overall PCI DSS compliance includes identifying
activities to be performed daily, weekly, monthly,
every three months, or annually, and ensuring
these activities are being performed accordingly
(for example, using a security self-assessment or
PDCA methodology).
Examples
Methodologies that support the management of
compliance programs include Plan-Do-Check-Act
(PDCA), ISO 27001, COBIT, DMAIC, and Six
Sigma.
```
```
A3.1.2 A formal PCI DSS compliance program is in
place that includes:
```
- Definition of activities for maintaining and
    monitoring overall PCI DSS compliance,
    including business-as-usual activities.
- Annual PCI DSS assessment processes.
- Processes for the continuous validation of PCI
    DSS requirements (for example, daily, weekly,
    every three months, as applicable per the
    requirement).
- A process for performing business-impact
    analysis to determine potential PCI DSS impacts
    for strategic business decisions.
**PCI DSS Reference** : _Requirements 1- 12_

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The formal definition of specific PCI DSS
compliance roles and responsibilities helps to
ensure accountability and monitoring of ongoing
PCI DSS compliance efforts.
Good Practice
Ownership should be assigned to individuals with
the authority to make risk-based decisions, and
upon whom accountability rests for the specific
function. Duties should be formally defined, and
owners should be able to demonstrate an
understanding of their responsibilities and
accountability.
Compliance roles may be assigned to a single
owner or multiple owners for different requirement
elements.
```
```
A3.1.3 PCI DSS compliance roles and
responsibilities are specifically defined and formally
assigned to one or more personnel, including:
```
- Managing PCI DSS business-as-usual activities.
- Managing annual PCI DSS assessments.
- Managing continuous validation of PCI DSS
    requirements (for example, daily, weekly, every
    three months, as applicable per the
    requirement).
- Managing business-impact analysis to determine
    potential PCI DSS impacts for strategic business
    decisions.

```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Personnel responsible for PCI DSS compliance
have specific training needs exceeding that which
is typically provided by general security
awareness training to enable them to perform
their role.
Good Practice
Individuals with PCI DSS compliance
responsibilities should receive specialized training
that, in addition to a general awareness of
information security, focuses on specific security
topics, skills, processes, or methodologies that
must be followed for those individuals to perform
their compliance responsibilities effectively.
Training may be offered by third parties such as
the PCI SSC (for example, PCI Awareness, PCIP,
and ISA), payment brands, and acquirers, or
training may be internal. Training content should
be applicable for the individual’s job function, be
current, and include the latest security threats
and/or version of PCI DSS.

A3.2 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Frequent validation of PCI DSS scope helps to
ensure PCI DSS scope remains up to date and
aligned with changing business objectives, and
therefore that security controls are protecting all
appropriate system components.
Good Practice
Accurate scoping involves critically evaluating the
CDE and all connected system components to
determine the necessary coverage for PCI DSS
requirements. Scoping activities, including careful
analysis and ongoing monitoring, help to ensure
that in-scope systems are appropriately secured.
When documenting account data locations, the
entity can consider creating a table or
spreadsheet that includes the following
information:
```
- Data stores (databases, files, cloud, etc.),
    including purpose of data storage and the
    retention period,
- Which CHD elements are stored (PAN, expiry
    date, cardholder name, and/or any elements of
    SAD prior to completion of authorization),
- How data is secured (type of encryption and
    strength, hashing algorithm and strength,
    truncation, tokenization),
- How access to data stores is logged, including
    a description of logging mechanism(s) in use
    (enterprise solution, application level,
    operating system level, etc.).
_(continued on next page)_

```
A3.2.1 PCI DSS scope is documented and
confirmed for accuracy at least once every three
months and upon significant changes to the in-
scope environment. At a minimum, the scoping
validation includes:
```
- Identifying all data flows for the various payment
    stages (for example, authorization, capture,
    settlement, chargebacks, and refunds) and
    acceptance channels (for example, card-present,
    card-not-present, and e-commerce).
- Updating all data-flow diagrams per
    Requirement 1.2.4.
- Identifying all locations where account data is
    stored, processed, and transmitted, including but
    not limited to 1) any locations outside of the
    currently defined CDE, 2) applications that
    process CHD, 3) transmissions between
    systems and networks, and 4) file backups.
- For any account data found outside of the
    currently defined CDE, either 1) securely delete
    it, 2) migrate it into the currently defined CDE, or
    3) expand the currently defined CDE to include
    it.
- Identifying all system components in the CDE,
    connected to the CDE, or that could impact
    security of the CDE.
- Identifying all segmentation controls in use and
    the environment(s) from which the CDE is
    segmented, including justification for
    environments being out of scope.
- Identifying all connections to third-party entities
    with access to the CDE.
_(continued on next page)_

```
A3.2.1.a Examine documented results of scope
reviews and interview personnel to verify that the
reviews are performed:
```
- At least once every three months.
- After significant changes to the in-scope
    environment.

```
A3.2.1.b Examine documented results of scope
reviews occurring at least once every three months
to verify that scoping validation includes all
elements specified in this requirement.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

- Confirming that all identified data flows, account
    data, system components, segmentation
    controls, and connections from third parties with
    access to the CDE are included in scope.
**PCI DSS Reference** : _Scope of PCI DSS
Requirements, Requirement 12._

```
In addition to internal systems and networks, all
connections from third-party entities—for
example, business partners, entities providing
remote support services, and other service
providers—need to be identified to determine
inclusion for PCI DSS scope. Once the in-scope
connections have been identified, the applicable
PCI DSS controls can be implemented to reduce
the risk of a third-party connection being used to
compromise an entity’s CDE.
A data discovery tool or methodology can be used
to facilitate identifying all sources and locations of
PAN, and to look for PAN that resides on systems
and networks outside the currently defined CDE
or in unexpected places within the defined CDE—
for example, in an error log or memory dump file.
This approach can help ensure that previously
unknown locations of PAN are detected and that
the PAN is either eliminated or properly secured.

```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Changes to systems or networks can have a
significant impact on PCI DSS scope. For
example, changes to network security control
rulesets can bring whole network segments into
scope, or new systems may be added to the CDE
that have to be appropriately protected.
A formal impact assessment performed in
advance of a change gives the entity assurance
that the change will not adversely affect the
security of the CDE.
Good Practice
Processes to determine the potential impact that
changes to systems and networks may have on
an entity’s PCI DSS scope may be performed as
part of a dedicated PCI DSS compliance program
or may fall under an entity’s overarching
compliance and/or governance program.
```
```
A3.2.2 PCI DSS scope impact for all changes to
systems or networks is determined, including
additions of new systems and new network
connections. Processes include:
```
- Performing a formal PCI DSS impact
    assessment.
- Identifying applicable PCI DSS requirements to
    the system or network.
- Updating PCI DSS scope as appropriate.
- Documented sign-off of the results of the impact
    assessment by responsible personnel (as

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
It is important to have processes to analyze all
changes made to systems or networks, to ensure
that all appropriate PCI DSS controls are applied
to any systems or networks added to the in-scope
environment due to a change.
Building this validation into change management
processes helps ensure that device inventories
and configuration standards are kept up to date,
and security controls are applied where needed.
Good Practice
A change management process should include
supporting evidence that PCI DSS requirements
are implemented or preserved through an iterative
process.
Examples
PCI DSS requirements that should be verified
include, but are not limited to:
```
- Network diagrams are updated to reflect
    changes.
- Systems are configured per configuration
    standards, with all default passwords changed
    and unnecessary services disabled.
- Systems are protected with required controls—
    for example, file integrity monitoring,
    anti-malware, patches, and audit logging.
- Sensitive authentication data is not stored, and
    that all account data storage is documented
    and incorporated into data-retention policy and
    procedures.
- New systems are included in the quarterly
    vulnerability scanning process.

```
A3.2.2.1 Upon completion of a change, all relevant
PCI DSS requirements are confirmed to be
implemented on all new or changed systems and
networks, and documentation is updated as
applicable.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
An organization’s structure and management
define the requirements and protocol for effective
and secure operations. Changes to this structure
could have negative effects to existing controls
and frameworks by reallocating or removing
resources that once supported PCI DSS controls
or inheriting new responsibilities that may not
have established controls in place. Therefore, it is
important to revisit PCI DSS scope and controls
when there are changes to an organization’s
structure and management to ensure controls are
in place and active.
Examples
Changes to organizational structure include, but
are not limited to, company mergers or
acquisitions, and significant changes or
reassignments of personnel with responsibility for
security control.
```
```
A3.2.3 Changes to organizational structure result in
a formal (internal) review of the impact to PCI DSS
scope and applicability of controls.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
PCI DSS normally requires segmentation controls
to be verified by penetration testing every twelve
months.
Validating segmentation controls more frequently
is likely to discover failings in segmentation before
they can be exploited by an attacker attempting to
pivot laterally from an out-of-scope untrusted
network to the CDE.
Good Practice
Although the requirement specifies that this scope
validation is carried out at least once every six
months and after a significant change, this
exercise should be performed as frequently as
possible to ensure it remains effective at isolating
the CDE from other networks.
Further Information
Refer to Information Supplement: Penetration
Testing Guidance for additional guidance.
```
```
A3.2.4 If segmentation is used, PCI DSS scope is
confirmed as follows:
```
- Per the entity’s methodology defined at
    Requirement 11.4.1.
- Penetration testing is performed on
    segmentation controls at least once every six
    months and after any changes to segmentation
    controls/methods.
- The penetration testing covers all segmentation
    controls/methods in use.
- The penetration testing verifies that
    segmentation controls/methods are operational
    and effective, and isolate the CDE from all out-
    of-scope systems.
**PCI DSS Reference** : _Requirement 11_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
PCI DSS requires that, as part of the scoping
exercise, assessed entities must identify and
document the existence of all cleartext PAN in
their environments. Implementing a data-
discovery methodology that identifies all sources
and locations of cleartext PAN and looks for
cleartext PAN on systems and networks outside
the currently defined CDE or in unexpected
places within the defined CDE—for example, in
an error log or memory dump file— helps to
ensure that previously unknown locations of
cleartext PAN are detected and properly secured.
Examples
A data-discovery process can be performed via a
variety of methods, including, but not limited to 1)
commercially available data-discovery software,
2) an in-house developed data-discovery
program, or 3) a manual search. A combination of
methodologies may also be used as needed.
Regardless of the method used, the goal of the
effort is to find all sources and locations of
cleartext PAN (not just in the defined CDE).
```
```
A3.2.5 A data-discovery methodology is
implemented that:
```
- Confirms PCI DSS scope.
- Locates all sources and locations of cleartext
    PAN at least once every three months and
    upon significant changes to the CDE or
    processes.
- Addresses the potential for cleartext PAN to
    reside on systems and networks outside the
    currently defined CDE.

A3.2.5.b Examine results from recent data
discovery efforts, and interview responsible
personnel to verify that data discovery is performed
at least once every three months and upon
significant changes to the CDE or processes.

```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
A process to test the effectiveness of the methods
used for data discovery ensures the
completeness and accuracy of account data
detection.
Good Practice
For completeness, system components in the in-
scope networks, and systems in out-of-scope
networks, should be included in the data-
discovery process.
The data-discovery process should be effective
on all operating systems and platforms in use.
Accuracy can be tested by placing test PANs on
system components and file formats in use and
confirming that the data-discovery method
detected the test PANs.
```
```
A3.2.5.1 Data discovery methods are confirmed as
follows:
```
- Effectiveness of methods is tested.
- Methods are able to discover cleartext PAN on
    all types of system components and file formats
    in use.
- The effectiveness of data-discovery methods is
    confirmed at least once every 12 months.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Having documented response procedures that are
followed in the event cleartext PAN is found
outside the CDE helps to identify the necessary
remediation actions and prevent future leaks.
Good Practice
If PAN was found outside the CDE, an analysis
should be performed to 1) determine whether it
was saved independently of other data or with
sensitive authentication data, 2) to identify the
source of the data, and 3) identify the control gaps
that resulted in the data being outside the CDE.
Entities should consider whether contributory
factors, such as business processes, user
behavior, improper system configurations, etc.,
caused the PAN to be stored in an unexpected
location. If such contributory factors are present,
they should be addressed per this Requirement to
prevent a recurrence.
```
```
A3.2.5.2 Response procedures are implemented to
be initiated upon the detection of cleartext PAN
outside the CDE to include:
```
- Determining what to do if cleartext PAN is
    discovered outside the CDE, including its
    retrieval, secure deletion, and/or migration into
    the currently defined CDE, as applicable.
- Determining how the data ended up outside the
    CDE.
- Remediating data leaks or process gaps that
    resulted in the data being outside the CDE.
- Identifying the source of the data.
- Identifying whether any track data is stored with
    the PANs.

```
A3.2.5.2.a Examine documented response
procedures to verify that procedures for responding
to the detection of cleartext PAN outside the CDE
are defined and include all elements specified in
this requirement.

The use of mechanisms to detect and prevent
unauthorized PAN from leaving the CDE allows
an organization to detect and prevent situations
that may lead to data loss.
Good Practice
Coverage of the mechanisms should include, but
not be limited to, e-mails, downloads to removable
media, and output to printers.
Examples
Mechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized
loss of cleartext PAN may include the use of
appropriate tools such as data loss prevention
(DLP) solutions as well as manual processes and
procedures.
```

A3.3 PCI DSS is incorporated into business-as-usual (BAU) activities.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without formal processes for the prompt (as soon
as possible) detection, alerting, and addressing of
critical security control failures, failures may go
undetected or remain unresolved for extended
periods. In addition, without formalized time-
bound processes, attackers will have ample time
to compromise systems and steal account data
from the CDE.
Good Practice
The specific types of failures may vary, depending
on the function of the device system component
and technology in use. Typical failures include a
system ceasing to perform its security function or
not functioning in its intended manner, such as a
firewall erasing all its rules or going offline.
```
```
A3.3.1 Failures of critical security control systems
are detected, alerted, and addressed promptly,

If alerts from failures of critical security control
systems are not responded to quickly and
effectively, attackers may use this time to insert
malicious software, gain control of a system, or
steal data from the entity’s environment.
Good Practice
Documented evidence (for example, records
within a problem management system) should
support processes and procedures in place that
respond to security failures. In addition, personnel
should be aware of their responsibilities in the
event of a failure. Actions and responses to the

- Identifying and documenting the cause(s) of
    failure, including root cause, and documenting
    remediation required to address the root cause.
- Identifying and addressing any security issues

Hardware and software technologies are
constantly evolving, and organizations need to be
aware of changes to the technologies they use, as
well as the evolving threats to those technologies.
Conducting appropriate reviews of these
technologies ensures that they can prepare for,
and manage, vulnerabilities in hardware and
software that will not be remediated by the vendor
or developer.
Good Practice
Organizations should also consider reviewing
firmware versions to ensure they remain current
and supported by the vendors.
Organizations also need to be aware of changes
made by technology vendors to their products or
processes to understand how such changes may
impact the organization’s use of the technology.
Regular reviews of technologies that impact or
influence PCI DSS controls can assist with
purchasing, usage, and deployment strategies
and ensure controls that rely on those

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Regularly confirming that security policies and
procedures are being followed provides
assurance that the expected controls are active
and working as intended. The objective of these
reviews is not to reperform other PCI DSS
requirements, but to confirm that security activities
are being performed on an ongoing basis.
Good Practice
These reviews can also be used to verify that
appropriate evidence is being maintained—for
example, audit logs, vulnerability scan reports,
reviews of network security control rulesets—to
assist in the entity’s preparation for its next PCI
DSS assessment.
Examples
Looking at Requirement 1.2.7 as one example,
Requirement A3.3.3 is met by confirming, at least
once every three months, that reviews of
configurations of network security controls have
occurred at the required frequency. On the other

The ability to identify attack patterns and
undesirable behavior across systems—for
example, using centrally managed or automated
log-correlation tools— is critical in preventing,
detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data
compromise. The presence of logs in all
environments allows thorough tracking, alerting,
and analysis when something goes wrong.
Determining the cause of a compromise is very
difficult, if not impossible, without a process to
corroborate information from critical system
components and systems that perform security
functions, such as network security controls,
IDS/IPS, and file integrity monitoring (FIM)
systems. Thus, logs for all critical system
components and systems that perform security
functions need to be collected, correlated, and
maintained. This could include using software
products and service methodologies to provide
real-time analysis, alerting, and reporting, such as
security information and event management
(SIEM), FIM, or change detection.
```

Compensating controls may be considered when an entity cannot meet a PCI DSS requirement explicitly as stated, due to legitimate and
documented technical or business constraints but has sufficiently mitigated the risk associated with the requirement through implementation of
other, or compensating, controls.
```
```
Compensating controls must satisfy the following criteria:
```
1. Meet the intent and rigor of the original PCI DSS requirement.
2. Provide a similar level of defense as the original PCI DSS requirement, such that the compensating control sufficiently offsets the risk
    that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to defend against. To understand the intent of a requirement, see _the Customized_
    _Approach Objective_ for most PCI DSS requirements. If a requirement is not eligible for the Customized Approach and therefore does not
    have a Customized Approach Objective, refer to the **Purpose** in the Guidance column for that requirement.
3. Be “above and beyond” other PCI DSS requirements. (Simply being in compliance with other PCI DSS requirements is not a
    compensating control.)
4. When evaluating “above and beyond” for compensating controls, consider the following:

```
Note: All compensating controls must be reviewed and validated for sufficiency by the assessor who conducts the PCI DSS
assessment. The effectiveness of a compensating control is dependent on the specifics of the environment in which the control is
implemented, the surrounding security controls, and the configuration of the control. Entities should be aware that a given compensating
control will not be effective in all environments.
```
```
a. Existing PCI DSS requirements CANNOT be considered as compensating controls if they are already required for the item under
review. For example, passwords for non-console administrative access must be sent encrypted to mitigate the risk of intercepting
cleartext administrative passwords. An entity cannot use other PCI DSS password requirements (intruder lockout, complex
passwords, etc.) to compensate for lack of encrypted passwords, since those other password requirements do not mitigate the risk
of interception of cleartext passwords. Also, the other password controls are already PCI DSS requirements for the item under
review (passwords).
```
```
b. Existing PCI DSS requirements MAY be considered as compensating controls if they are required for another area but are not
required for the item under review.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
c. Existing PCI DSS requirements may be combined with new controls to become a compensating control. For example, if a company
is unable to address a vulnerability that is exploitable through a network interface because a security update is not yet available
from a vendor, a compensating control could consist of controls that include all of the following: 1) internal network segmentation, 2)
limiting network access to the vulnerable interface to only required devices (IP address or MAC address filtering), and 3) IDS/IPS
monitoring of all traffic destined to the vulnerable interface.
```
5. Address the additional risk imposed by not adhering to the PCI DSS requirement.
6. Address the requirement currently and in the future. A compensating control cannot address a requirement that was missed in the past
    (for example, where performance of a task was required two quarters ago, but that task was not performed).

```
The assessor is required to thoroughly evaluate compensating controls during each annual PCI DSS assessment to confirm that each
compensating control adequately addresses the risk that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to address, per items 1-6 above.
```
```
To maintain compliance, processes and controls must be in place to ensure compensating controls remain effective after the assessment is
complete. Additionally, compensating control results must be documented in the applicable report for the assessment (for example, a Report
on Compliance or a Self-Assessment Questionnaire) in the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section, and included when the applicable
report is submitted to the requesting organization.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

## Appendix C Compensating Controls Worksheet

```
The entity must use this worksheet to define compensating controls for any requirement where compensating controls are used to meet a PCI
DSS requirement. Note that compensating controls should also be documented in accordance with instructions in the Report on Compliance in
the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section.
```
```
Note: Only entities that have legitimate and documented technological or business constraints can consider the use of compensating controls
to achieve compliance.
```
**Requirement Number and Definition:**

```
Information Required Explanation
```
**1. Constraints** Document the legitimate technical or business
    constraints precluding compliance with the
    original requirement.
**2. Definition of Compensating Controls** Define the compensating controls: explain how
    they address the objectives of the original
    control and the increased risk, if any.
**3. Objective** Define the objective of the original control (for
    example, the Customized Approach Objective).

```
Identify the objective met by the compensating
control (note: this can be, but is not required to
be, the stated Customized Approach Objective
for the PCI DSS requirement).
```
**4. Identified Risk** Identify any additional risk posed by the lack of
    the original control.
**5. Validation of Compensating Controls** Define how the compensating controls were
    validated and tested.
**6. Maintenance** Define process(es) and controls in place to
    maintain compensating controls.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

## Appendix D Customized Approach

```
This approach is intended for entities that decide to meet a PCI DSS requirement’s stated Customized Approach Objective in a way that does
not strictly follow the defined requirement. The customized approach allows an entity to take a strategic approach to meeting a requirement’s
Customized Approach Objective, so it can determine and design the security controls needed to meet the objective in a manner unique for that
organization.
```
```
The entity implementing a customized approach must satisfy the following criteria:
```
```
 Document and maintain evidence about each customized control, including all information specified in the Controls Matrix Template in
Appendix E1.
```
```
 Perform and document a targeted risk analysis (PCI DSS Requirement 12.3.2) for each customized control, including all information
specified in the Targeted Risk Analysis Template in Appendix E2.
```
```
 Perform testing of each customized control to prove effectiveness, and document testing performed, methods used, what was tested,
when testing was performed, and results of testing in the controls matrix.
```
```
 Monitor and maintain evidence about the effectiveness of each customized control.
```
```
 Provide completed controls matrix(es), targeted risk analysis, testing evidence, and evidence of customized control effectiveness to its
assessor.
```
```
The assessor performing an assessment of customized controls must satisfy the following criteria:
```
```
 Review the entity’s controls matrix(es), targeted risk analysis, and evidence of control effectiveness to fully understand the customized
control(s) and to verify the entity meets all Customized Approach documentation and evidence requirements.
```
```
 Derive and document the appropriate testing procedures needed to conduct thorough testing of each customized control.
```
```
 Test each customized control to determine whether the entity’s implementation 1) meets the requirement’s Customized Approach
Objective and 2) results in an “in place” finding for the requirement.
```
```
 At all times, QSAs maintain independence requirements defined in the QSA Qualification Requirements. This means if a QSA is
involved in designing or implementing a customized control, that QSA does not also derive testing procedures for, assess, or assist with
the assessment of that customized control.
```
```
The entity and its assessor are expected to work together to ensure 1) they agree that the customized control(s) fully meets the customized
approach objective, 2) the assessor fully understands the customized control, and 3) the entity understands the derived testing the assessor
will perform.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Use of the customized approach must be completed by a QSA or ISA and documented in accordance with instructions in the Report on
Compliance (ROC) Template and following the instructions in the FAQs for use with PCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template available on the PCI SSC
website.
```
```
Entities that complete a Self-Assessment Questionnaire are not eligible to use a customized approach; however, these entities may elect to
have a QSA or ISA perform their assessment and document it in a ROC Template.
```
```
The use of the customized approach may be regulated by organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment brands and
acquirers). Therefore, questions about use of a customized approach must be referred to those organizations, including, for example, whether
an entity is required to use a QSA, or may use an ISA to complete an assessment using the customized approach.
```
```
Note: Compensating controls are not an option with the customized approach. Because the customized approach allows an entity to
determine and design the controls needed to meet a requirement’s Customized Approach Objective, the entity is expected to effectively
implement the controls it designed for that requirement without needing to also implement alternate, compensating controls.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

## Appendix E Sample Templates to Support Customized Approach

```
This appendix contains example templates for the controls matrix and a targeted risk analysis, to be documented by the entity as part of the
customized approach. These templates are examples of formats that could be used. While it is not required that entities follow the specific
formats provided in this appendix, the entity’s control matrix and targeted risk analysis must include all the information as defined in these
templates.
```
### E1 Sample Controls Matrix Template

```
The following is a sample controls matrix template that an entity may use to document their customized implementation.
```
```
As described in Appendix D: Customized Approach , entities using the customized approach must complete a controls matrix to provide details
for each implemented control that explain what is implemented, how the entity has determined that the controls meet the stated objective of a
PCI DSS requirement, how the control provides at least the equivalent level of protection as would be achieved by meeting the defined
requirement, and how the entity has assurance about the effectiveness of the control on an ongoing basis.
```
```
The assessor uses the information within each controls matrix to plan and prepare for the assessment.
```
```
This sample controls matrix template includes the minimum information to be documented by the entity and provided to the assessor for a
customized validation. While it is not required that this specific template be used, it is required that the entity’s customized approach
documentation includes all information defined in this template, and that the entity provides this exact information to its assessor.
```
```
The controls matrix does not replace the need for the assessor to independently develop appropriate testing procedures for
validating the implemented controls. The assessor must still perform the necessary testing to verify the controls meet the objective of the
requirement, are effective, and are properly maintained. The controls matrix also does not replace the reporting requirements for customized
validations as specified in the ROC Template.
```
```
The controls matrix must include at least the information in the following table.
```
```

```
```
Details of control(s)
```
```
What is the implemented control(s)? <Entity describes what the control is and what it does>
```
```
Where is the control(s) implemented? <Entity identifies locations of facilities and system components where control is
implemented and managed>
```
```
When is the control(s) performed? <Entity details how frequently the control is performed – for example, runs
continuously in real time or is scheduled to run at NN times and at XX intervals>
```
```
Who has overall responsibility and accountability for the control(s)? <Entity includes details of individual personnel/roles with responsibility and
accountability for this control>

Who is involved in managing, maintaining, and monitoring the
control(s)?
```
```
<Entity includes details of individual personnel/roles and/or teams, as applicable,
that manage, maintain, and monitor the control>
```
```
For each PCI DSS requirement the control(s) is used for, the entity provides details of the following:
```
```
Entity describes how the implemented control(s) meets the stated
Customized Approach Objective of the PCI DSS requirement.
```
```
<Entity describes how the control meets the stated customized approach
objective of the PCI DSS requirement, and summarizes related results>
```
```
Entity describes testing it performed and the results of that testing
that demonstrates the control(s) meets the objective of the applicable
requirement.
```
```
<Entity describes the testing it performed to prove the control meets the stated
objective of the PCI DSS requirement, and summarizes related results>
```
```
Entity briefly describes the results of the separate targeted risk
analysis it performed that explains the control(s) implemented and
describes how the results verify the control(s) provides at least an
equivalent level of protection as the defined approach for the
applicable PCI DSS requirement. See the separate Targeted Risk
Analysis Template for details on how to document this risk analysis.

To be completed by the entity being assessed
```
```
Entity describes the measures it has implemented to ensure the
control(s) is maintained and its effectiveness is assured on an ongoing
basis. For example, how the entity monitors for control effectiveness,
how control failures are detected and responded to, and the actions
taken.
```
```
<Entity describes how it ensures the control is maintained and how the control's
effectiveness is assured.>
```
### E2 Sample Targeted Risk Analysis Template

```
The following is a sample targeted risk analysis template an entity may use for their customized implementation. While it is not required that an
entity follow this specific format, its customized approach documentation must include all the information defined in this template.
```
```
As described in Appendix D: Customized Approach and in accordance with PCI DSS Requirement 12.3.2, an entity using the customized
approach must provide a detailed targeted risk analysis for each requirement the entity is meeting with the customized approach. The risk
analysis defines the risk, evaluates the effect on security if the defined requirement is not met, and describes how the entity has determined
that the controls provide at least an equivalent level of protection as provided by the defined PCI DSS requirement.
```
```
The assessor uses the information in the targeted risk analysis to plan and prepare for the assessment.
```
```
In completing a targeted risk analysis for a customized approach, it is important to remember that:
```
```
 The asset being protected is the cardholder data that is stored, processed, or transmitted by
the entity.
```
```
 The threat actor is highly motivated and capable. The motivation and capability of threat actors
tends to increase in relation to the volume of cardholder data that a successful attack will
realize.
```
```
 The likelihood that an entity will be targeted by threat actors increases as the entity stores,
processes, or transmits greater volumes of cardholder data.
```
```
 The mischief is directly related to the objective. For example, if the objective is “malicious
software cannot execute”, the mischief is that malicious software executes; if the objective is “day-to-day responsibilities for performing
all the activities are allocated”, the mischief is that the responsibilities are not allocated.
```
```
Note: The term “mischief” as used
in this targeted risk analysis (for
example, in 1.3 in the table below)
refers to an occurrence or event
that negatively affects the security
posture of the entity. Examples of
this are the absence of a policy, the
failure to conduct a vulnerability
scan, or that malware executes in
the entity’s environment.
```

```
This sample targeted risk analysis template includes the minimum information to be documented by the entity and provided to the assessor for
a customized validation. While it is not required that this specific template be used, it is required that the entity’s customized approach
documentation include all information defined in this template, and that the entity provides this exact information to its assessor.
```
```
The targeted risk analysis must include at least the information in the following table.

**3. Analyze any changes to the LIKELIHOOD of the mischief occurring, leading to a breach in confidentiality of cardholder data**

```
3.1 Describe the factors detailed in the Control Matrix
that affect the likelihood of the mischief occurring.
```
```
Entity describes:
```
- How successful the controls will be at preventing the mischief
- How the controls detailed in the Control Matrix reduce the likelihood of the mischief occurring

```
3.2 Describe the reasons the mischief may still occur
after the application of the customized control.
```
```
Entity describes:
```
- The typical reasons for the control to fail, the likelihood of this, and how could it be prevented
- How resilient the entity’s processes and systems are for detecting that the control(s) are not
    operating normally?
- How a threat actor could bypass this control – what steps would they need to take, how hard
    is it, would the threat actor be detected before the control failed? How has this been
    determined?

```
3.3 To what extent do the controls detailed in the
customized approach represent a change in the
likelihood of the mischief occurring when compared with
the defined approach requirement?

```
```
4.1.2 Number of PANs processed or
transmitted over a 12-month period
```
```
Total
```
```
4.2 Description of how the customized controls will
directly:
```
- Reduce the number of individual PANs compromised
    if a threat actor is successful, and/or
- Allow quicker notification of the PANs compromised
    to the card brands.

```
Impact to the payment ecosystem is directly related to the number of accounts compromised and
how quickly any compromised PANs can be blocked by the card issuer.
Entity describes how the customized controls achieve the following if any of the customized
controls:
```
- Reduce the volume of cardholder data that is stored, processed, or transmitted and therefore
    reduce what is available to a successful threat actor, and/or
- Decrease the time to detection, notification of compromised accounts, and containment of the
    threat actor.
**5. Risk approval and review**

```
5.1 I have reviewed the above risk analysis and I agree
that the use of the proposed customized approach as
detailed provides at least an equivalent level of protection
as the defined approach for the applicable PCI DSS
requirement.
```
```
A member of executive management must review and agree to the proposed customized
approach.
<Member of entity’s executive management signs that it reviewed and agreed to the customized
approach documented herein.>
```
```
5.2 This risk analysis must be reviewed and updated no
later than:
```
```
The risk analysis should be reviewed at least every twelve months and more frequently if the
customized approach itself is time limited (for example, because there is a planned change in
technology) or if other factors dictate a needed change. In the event of an unscheduled risk
review, detail the reason the review occurred.
<Entity indicates date the targeted risk analysis was reviewed and updated.>

## Appendix F Leveraging the PCI Software Security Framework to Support

## Requirement 6

```
PCI DSS Requirement 6 defines requirements for the development and maintenance of secure systems and software. Because the PCI SSC
Secure Software Standard and the Secure SLC Standard (collectively, the Software Security Framework) include rigorous software security
requirements, the use of bespoke and custom software that is developed and maintained in accordance with either standard can help the
entity to meet several requirements in PCI DSS Requirement 6 without having to perform additional detailed testing, and may also support use
of the Customized Approach for other requirements. For details, see Table 7.
```
```
Note : This support for meeting Requirement 6 applies only to software that is specifically developed and maintained in accordance with the
Secure Software Standard or the Secure SLC Standard; it does not extend to other software or system components in scope for
Requirement 6.
```

```
PCI DSS requirements/objectives apply as usual.
Software developed and maintained in accordance with the Secure SLC Standard may support the
customized approach for Requirement 6.3 objectives.
While use of software developed and maintained in accordance with the Secure SLC Standard provides
assurance that the vendor makes security patches and software updates available in a timely manner, the
entity retains responsibility for ensuring that patches and updates are installed in accordance with PCI
DSS requirements.

While use of software developed and maintained in accordance with the Secure SLC Standard provides
assurance that the vendor follows change management procedures during development of software and
related updates, the entity retains responsibility for ensuring that software and other changes to system
components are implemented into its production environment in accordance with PCI DSS requirements.
```
**_Use of Bespoke and Custom Software Developed and Maintained by a Secure SLC Qualified Vendor_**

```
When validating the use of software developed and maintained by a Secure SLC Qualified Vendor to meet PCI DSS Requirement 6.2 and
support the Customized Approach for Requirements 6.3 and 6.5, the assessor must confirm that the following is met:
```
```
 The software vendor has a current listing on the PCI SSC List of Secure SLC Qualified Vendors—that is, the validation has not expired.
```
```
 The software was developed and is being maintained using software lifecycle management practices that were assessed as part of the
software vendor’s validation.
```
```
 The entity is following the implementation guidance provided by the Secure SLC Qualified Vendor.
```
**_Use of Bespoke and Custom Software Developed in Accordance with the Secure SLC Standard_**

```
Entities that internally develop software solely for their use or that develop software for use by a single entity may choose to engage a Secure
SLC Assessor to assess their software lifecycle management practices against the Secure SLC Standard. The Secure SLC Assessor will
document the results of the assessment in a Secure SLC Report on Compliance (ROC) and a Secure SLC Attestation of Compliance (AOC).
```
```
Software that is developed and maintained following software lifecycle management practices provides the same support for PCI DSS
Requirement 6 as software developed and maintained by a Secure SLC Qualified Vendor, if those practices were assessed by a Secure SLC
Assessor and confirmed to meet the Secure SLC Standard requirements, with the results documented in a Secure SLC ROC and AOC.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

**_Validating the Use of the Secure SLC Standard_**

```
When validating the use of software developed and maintained in accordance with the Secure SLC Standard to meet PCI DSS Requirement
6.2 and support customized approach for Requirements 6.3 and 6.5, the assessor must confirm that the following are met:
```
```
 The software lifecycle management practices were assessed by a Secure SLC Assessor and confirmed to meet all Secure SLC
Standard requirements with the results documented in a Secure SLC Report on Compliance (ROC) and Secure SLC Attestation of
Compliance (AOC).
```
```
 The software was developed and maintained using the software lifecycle management practices covered by the Secure SLC
assessment.
```
```
 A full Secure SLC assessment of the software lifecycle management practices was completed within the previous 36 months.
Additionally, if the most recent full Secure SLC assessment occurred more than 12 months ago, an Annual Attestation was provided by
the developer/vendor within the previous 12 months that confirms continued adherence to Secure SLC Standard for the software
lifecycle management practices in use.
```
**_Validating the Use of the Secure Software Standard_**

```
When validating the use of software developed and maintained in accordance with the Secure Software Standard to meet PCI DSS
Requirement 6.2.4 and support customized approach for Requirements 6.3 and 6.5, the assessor must confirm that the following are met:
```
```
 The secure software assessment was conducted by a Secure Software Assessor and confirmed to meet all requirements in the Secure
Software Standard with the results documented in a Secure Software Report on Validation (ROV) and Secure Software Attestation of
Validation (AOV).
```
```
 The software was developed and is being maintained using the software lifecycle management practices that were covered by the
Secure Software assessment.
```
```
 A full Secure Software assessment was completed within the previous 36 months. Additionally, if the most recent full Secure Software
assessment occurred more than 12 months ago, an Annual Attestation was provided by the developer/vendor within the previous 12
months that confirms continued adherence to Secure Software Standard.

provide a minimum of 112-bits of effective key strength and proper key-management practices.
Effective key strength can be shorter than the actual ‘bit’ length of the key, which can lead to algorithms with larger keys providing
lesser protection than algorithms with smaller actual, but larger effective, key sizes. It is recommended that all new implementations
use a minimum of 128-bits of effective key strength.
Examples of industry references on cryptographic algorithms and key lengths include:
```
- _NIST Special Publication 800-57 Part 1_ ,
- _BSI TR-02102-1_ ,
- _ECRYPT-CSA D5.4 Algorithms, Key Size and Protocols Report (2018)_ , and
- _ISO/IEC 18033 Encryption algorithms,_ and
- _ISO/IEC 14888-3:2-81 IT Security techniques – Digital signatures with appendix – Part 3: Discrete logarithm based mechanisms_.

```
System Components Any network devices, servers, computing devices, virtual components, or software included in or connected to the CDE, or that could
impact the security of the CDE.
```
```
System-level object Anything on a system component that is required for its operation, including but not limited to application executables and
configuration files, system configuration files, static and shared libraries and DLLs, system executables, device drivers and device
configuration files, and third-party components.
```
```
Targeted Risk
Analysis
```
```
For PCI DSS purposes, a risk analysis that focuses on a specific PCI DSS requirement(s) of interest, either because the requirement
allows flexibility (for example, as to frequency) or, for the Customized Approach, to explain how the entity assessed the risk and
determined the customized control meets the objective of a PCI DSS requirement.
```
```
TDES Acronym for “Triple Data Encryption Standard.” Also referred to as “3DES” or “Triple DES.”
```
```
Telnet Abbreviation for “telephone network protocol.”
```
```
Third-Party Service
Provider (TPSP)
```
```
Any third party acting as a service provider on behalf of an entity. See Multi-Tenant Service Provider and Service Provider.
```
```
Third-Party Software Software that is acquired by, but not developed expressly for, an entity. It may be open source, freeware, shareware, or purchased.
```
```
TLS Acronym for “Transport Layer Security.”
```
```
Token In the context of authentication and access control, a token is a value provided by hardware or software that works with an
authentication server or VPN to perform dynamic or multi-factor authentication.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Term Definition
```
```
Track Data Also referred to as “full track data” or “magnetic-stripe data.” Data encoded in the magnetic stripe or chip used for authentication
and/or authorization during payment transactions. Can be the magnetic-stripe image on a chip or the track data on the magnetic
stripe.
```
```
Truncation Method of rendering a full PAN unreadable by removing a segment of PAN data. Truncation relates to protection of PAN when
electronically stored , processed, or transmitted.
See Masking for protection of PAN when displayed on screens, paper receipts, etc.
```
```
Trusted Network Network of an entity that is within the entity’s ability to control or manage and that meets applicable PCI DSS requirements.
```
```
Untrusted Network Any network that does not meet the definition of a “trusted network.”
```
```
Virtual Payment
Terminal
```
```
In the context of Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) C-VT, a virtual payment terminal is web-browser-based access to an acquirer,
processor, or third-party service provider website to authorize payment card transactions, where the merchant manually enters
payment card data through a web browser. Unlike physical terminals, virtual payment terminals do not read data directly from a
payment card. Because payment card transactions are entered manually, virtual payment terminals are typically used instead of
physical terminals in merchant environments with low transaction volumes.
```
```
Virtualization The logical abstraction of computing resources from physical and/or logical constraints. One common abstraction is referred to as
virtual machines or VMs, which takes the content of a physical machine and allows it to operate on different physical hardware and/or
along with other virtual machines on the same physical hardware. Other common abstractions include, but are not limited to,
containers, serverless computing, or microservices.
```
```
VPN Acronym for “virtual private network.”
```
```
Vulnerability Flaw or weakness which, if exploited, may result in an intentional or unintentional compromise of a system.
```
```
Web Application An application that is generally accessed through a web browser or through web services. Web applications may be available through
the Internet or a private, internal network.

## 1 Introduction and PCI Data Security Standard Overview

```
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) was developed to encourage and enhance payment card account data security
and facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures globally. PCI DSS provides a baseline of technical and operational
requirements designed to protect account data. While specifically designed to focus on environments with payment card account data, PCI
DSS can also be used to protect against threats and secure other elements in the payment ecosystem.
```

This document, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Requirements and Testing Procedures, consists of the 12 PCI DSS
principal requirements, detailed security requirements, corresponding testing procedures, and other information pertinent to each requirement.
The following sections provide detailed guidelines and best practices to assist entities to prepare for, conduct, and report the results of a PCI
DSS assessment. The PCI DSS requirements and testing procedures begin on page 43.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
PCI DSS comprises a minimum set of requirements for protecting account data and may be enhanced by additional controls and practices to
further mitigate risks, and to incorporate local, regional, and sector laws and regulations. Additionally, legislation or regulatory requirements
may require specific protection of personal information or other data elements (for example, cardholder name).
```
**_Limitations_**

If any of the requirements contained in this standard conflict with country, state, or local laws, the country, state, or local law will apply.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

## 2 PCI DSS Applicability Information

```
PCI DSS is intended for all entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data (CHD) and/or sensitive authentication data (SAD) or could
impact the security of the cardholder data environment (CDE). This includes all entities involved in payment card account processing —
including merchants, processors, acquirers, issuers, and other service providers.
```
```
Whether any entity is required to comply with or validate their compliance to PCI DSS is at the discretion of those organizations that manage
compliance programs (such as payment brands and acquirers). Contact the organizations of interest for any additional criteria.
```
### Defining Account Data, Cardholder Data, and Sensitive Authentication Data

```
Cardholder data and sensitive authentication data are considered account data and are defined as follows:
```
**Table 2. Account Data**

```
Account Data
```
```
Cardholder Data includes: Sensitive Authentication Data includes:
```
- Primary Account Number (PAN)
- Cardholder Name
- Expiration Date
- Service Code
    - Full track data (magnetic-stripe data or equivalent on a chip)
    - Card verification code
    - PINs/PIN blocks

```
PCI DSS requirements apply to entities with environments where account data (cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data) is stored,
processed, or transmitted, and entities with environments that can impact the security of the CDE. Some PCI DSS requirements may also
apply to entities with environments that do not store, process, or transmit account data – for example, entities that outsource payment
operations or management of their CDE^1. Entities that outsource their payment environments or payment operations to third parties remain
responsible for ensuring that the account data is protected by the third party per applicable PCI DSS requirements.
```
```
The primary account number (PAN) is the defining factor for cardholder data. The term account data therefore covers the following: the full
PAN, any other elements of cardholder data that are present with the PAN, and any elements of sensitive authentication data.
```
(^1) In accordance with those organizations that manage compliance programs (such as payment brands and acquirers); entities should contact the organizations of
interest for more details.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
If cardholder name, service code, and/or expiration date are stored, processed, or transmitted with the PAN, or are otherwise present in the
CDE, they must be protected in accordance with the PCI DSS requirements applicable to cardholder data.
```
```
If an entity stores, processes, or transmits PAN, then a CDE exists to which PCI DSS requirements will apply. Some requirements may not be
applicable, for example if the entity does not store PAN, then the requirements relating to the protection of stored PAN in Requirement 3 will
not be applicable to the entity.
```
```
Even if an entity does not store, process, or transmit PAN, some PCI DSS requirements may still apply. Consider the following:
```
```
 If the entity stores SAD, requirements specifically related to SAD storage in Requirement 3 will be applicable.
```
```
 If the entity engages third-party service providers to store, process or transmit PAN on its behalf, requirements related to the
management of service providers in Requirement 12 will be applicable.
```
```
 If the entity can impact the security of a CDE because the security of an entity’s infrastructure can affect how cardholder data is
processed (for example, via a web server that controls the generation of a payment form or page) some requirements will be applicable.
```
```
 If cardholder data is only present on physical media (for example paper), requirements relating to the security and disposal of physical
media in Requirement 9 will be applicable.
```
```
 Requirements related to an incident response plan are applicable to all entities, to ensure that there are procedures to follow in the
event of a suspected or actual breach of the confidentiality of cardholder data.
```
**_Use of Account Data, Sensitive Authentication Data, Cardholder Data, and Primary Account Number in PCI DSS_**

```
PCI DSS includes requirements that specifically refer to account data, cardholder data, and sensitive authentication data. It is important
to note that each of these types of data are different and the terms are not interchangeable. Specific references within requirements to
account data, cardholder data, or sensitive authentication data are purposeful, and the requirements apply specifically to the type of
data that is referenced.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

**_Elements of Account Data and Storage Requirements_**

```
Table 3 identifies the elements of cardholder and sensitive authentication data, whether storage of each data element is permitted or
prohibited, and whether each data element must be rendered unreadable—for example, with strong cryptography—when stored. This
table is not exhaustive and is presented to illustrate only how the stated requirements apply to the different data elements.
```
**Table 3. Account Data Element Storage Requirements**

```
Data Elements Storage Restrictions Required to Render Stored Data
Unreadable
```
```
Account Data
```
```
Cardholder
Data
```
```
Primary Account Number (PAN)
Storage is kept to a minimum as defined in
Requirement 3.
Yes, as defined in Requirement 3.
```
```

Data
```
```
Full Track Data
Cannot be stored after authorization as
defined in Requirement 3.3.1^3
```
```
Yes, data stored until authorization is
complete must be protected with strong
cryptography as defined in Requirement
3.3.
```
```
Card verification code
```
```
PIN/PIN Block
```
```
If PAN is stored with other elements of cardholder data, only the PAN must be rendered unreadable according to PCI DSS Requirement 3.5.1.
```
```
Sensitive authentication data must not be stored after authorization, even if encrypted. This applies even for environments where there is no
PAN present.
```
(^2) Where data exists in the same environment as PAN.
(^3) Except as permitted for issuers and companies that support issuing services. Requirements for issuers and issuing services are separately defined in
Requirement 3.3.3.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

## 3 Relationship between PCI DSS and PCI SSC Software Standards

```
PCI SSC supports the use of secure payment software within cardholder data environments (CDE) via the Payment Application Data Security
Standard (PA-DSS) and the Software Security Framework (SSF), which consists of the Secure Software Standard and the Secure Software
Lifecycle (Secure SLC) Standard. Software that is PCI SSC validated and listed provides assurance that the software has been developed
using secure practices and has met a defined set of software security requirements.
```
```
The PCI SSC secure software programs include listings of payment software and software
vendors that have been validated as meeting the applicable PCI SSC Software Standards.
```
```
 Validated Software : Payment software listed on the PCI SSC website as a
Validated Payment Application (PA-DSS) or Validated Payment Software (the
Secure Software Standard) has been evaluated by a qualified assessor to confirm
the software meets the security requirements within that standard. The security
requirements in these standards are focused on protecting the integrity and
confidentiality of payment transactions and account data.
```
```
 Validated Software Vendors : The Secure SLC Standard defines security
requirements for software vendors to integrate secure software development
practices throughout the entire software lifecycle. Software vendors that have been
validated as meeting the Secure SLC Standard are listed on the PCI SSC website
as a Secure SLC Qualified Vendor.
```
```
For more information about the SSF or PA-DSS, refer to the respective Program Guides at http://www.pcisecuritystandards.org.
```
```
All software that stores, processes, or transmits account data, or that could impact the security of account data or a CDE, is in scope for an
entity’s PCI DSS assessment. While the use of validated payment software supports the security of an entity’s CDE, the use of such software
does not by itself make an entity PCI DSS compliant. The entity’s PCI DSS assessment should include verification that the software is properly
configured and securely implemented to support applicable PCI DSS requirements. Additionally, if PCI-listed payment software has been
customized, a more in-depth review will be required during the PCI DSS assessment because the software may no longer be representative of
the version that was originally validated.
```
```
Because security threats are constantly evolving, software that is no longer supported by the vendor (for example, identified by the vendor as
“end of life”) may not offer the same level of security as supported versions. Entities are strongly encouraged to keep their software current
and updated to the latest software versions available.
```
```
Entities that develop their own software are encouraged to refer to PCI SSC’s software security standards and consider the requirements
therein as best practices to use in their development environments. Secure payment software implemented in a PCI DSS compliant
environment will help minimize the potential for security breaches leading to compromises of account data and fraud. See Bespoke and
Custom Software.
```
```
Note: PA-DSS and the related program will be
retired in October 2022. Refer to the PCI SSC
List of Validated Payment Applications for
expiry dates for PA-DSS validated
applications. After the expiry date, applications
are listed as “Acceptable only for Pre-Existing
Deployments.” Whether an entity can continue
to use a PA-DSS application with an expired
listing is at the discretion of organizations that
manage compliance programs (such as
payment brands and acquirers); entities should
contact the organizations of interest for more
details.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

### Applicability of PCI DSS to Payment Software Vendors

```
PCI DSS may apply to a payment software vendor if the vendor is also a service provider that stores, processes, or transmits account
data, or has access to their customers’ account data—for example, in the role of a payment service provider or via remote access to a
customer environment. Software vendors to which PCI DSS may be applicable include those offering payment services, as well as cloud
service providers offering payment terminals in the cloud, software as a service (SaaS), e-commerce in the cloud, and other cloud
payment services.
```
### Bespoke and Custom Software

```
All bespoke and custom software that stores, processes, or transmits
account data, or that could impact the security of account data or a CDE,
is in scope for an entity’s PCI DSS assessment.
```
```
Bespoke and custom software that has been developed and maintained
in accordance with one of PCI SSC’s Software Security Framework
standards (the Secure Software Standard or the Secure SLC standard)
will support an entity in meeting PCI DSS Requirement 6.
```
```
See Appendix F for more details.
```
```
Note: PCI DSS Requirement 6 fully applies to bespoke
and custom software that has not been developed and
maintained in accordance with one of PCI SSC’s Software
Security Framework standards. Entities that use software
vendors to develop bespoke or custom software that
could impact the security of account data or their CDE are
responsible for ensuring those software vendors develop
the software according to PCI DSS Requirement 6.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

## 4 Scope of PCI DSS Requirements

```
PCI DSS requirements apply to:
```
```
 The cardholder data environment (CDE), which is comprised of:
```
- System components, people, and processes that store, process, and transmit cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data,
    and,
- System components that may not store, process, or transmit CHD/SAD but have unrestricted connectivity to system components
    that store, process, or transmit CHD/SAD.

```
AND
```
```
 System components, people, and processes that could impact the security of the CDE.^4
```
```
“System components” include network devices, servers, computing devices, virtual components, cloud components, and software. Examples
of system components include but are not limited to:
```
```
 Systems that store, process, or transmit account data (for example, payment terminals, authorization systems, clearing systems,
payment middleware systems, payment back-office systems, shopping cart and store front systems, payment gateway/switch systems,
fraud monitoring systems).
```
```
 Systems that provide security services (for example, authentication servers, access control servers, security information and event
management (SIEM) systems, physical security systems (for example, badge access or CCTV), multi-factor authentication systems,
anti-malware systems).
```
```
 Systems that facilitate segmentation (for example, internal network security controls).
```
```
 Systems that could impact the security of account data or the CDE (for example, name resolution, or e-commerce (web) redirection
servers).
```
```
 Virtualization components such as virtual machines, virtual switches/routers, virtual appliances, virtual applications/desktops, and
hypervisors.
```
```
 Cloud infrastructure and components, both external and on premises, and including instantiations of containers or images, virtual private
clouds, cloud-based identity and access management, CDEs residing on premises or in the cloud, service meshes with containerized
applications, and container orchestration tools.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
 Network components, including but not limited to network security controls, switches, routers, VoIP network devices, wireless access
points, network appliances, and other security appliances.
```
```
 Server types, including but not limited to web, application, database, authentication, mail, proxy, Network Time Protocol (NTP), and
Domain Name System (DNS).
```
```
 End-user devices, such as computers, laptops, workstations, administrative workstations, tablets, and mobile devices.
```
```
 Printers, and multi-function devices that scan, print, and fax.
```
```
 Storage of account data in any format (for example, paper, data files, audio files, images, and video recordings).
```
```
 Applications, software, and software components, serverless applications, including all purchased, subscribed (for example, Software-
as-a-Service), bespoke and custom software, including internal and external (for example, Internet) applications.
```
```
 Tools, code repositories, and systems that implement software configuration management or for deployment of objects to the CDE or to
systems that can impact the CDE.

### Annual PCI DSS Scope Confirmation

```
The first step in preparing for a PCI DSS assessment is for the entity to accurately determine the scope of the review. The assessed entity
must confirm the accuracy of their PCI DSS scope according to PCI DSS Requirement 12.5.2 by identifying all locations and flows of account
data, and identifying all systems that are connected to or, if compromised, could impact the CDE (for example, authentication servers, remote
access servers, logging servers) to ensure they are included in the PCI DSS scope. All types of systems and locations should be considered
during the scoping process, including backup/recovery sites and fail-over systems.
```
```
The minimum steps for an entity to confirm the accuracy of their PCI DSS scope are specified in PCI DSS Requirement 12.5.2. The entity is
expected to retain documentation to show how PCI DSS scope was determined. The documentation is retained for assessor review and for
reference during the entity’s next PCI DSS scope confirmation activity. For each PCI DSS assessment, the assessor validates that the entity
accurately defined and documented the scope of the assessment.
```
```
Note : This annual confirmation of PCI DSS scope is defined at PCI DSS Requirement at 12.5.2 and is an activity expected to be performed by
the entity. This activity is not the same, nor is it intended to be replaced by, the scoping confirmation performed by the entity’s assessor during
the assessment.
```
### Segmentation

```
Segmentation (or isolation) of the CDE from the remainder of an entity’s network is not a PCI DSS requirement. However, it is strongly
recommended as a method that may reduce the:
```
```
 Scope of the PCI DSS assessment
```
```
 Cost of the PCI DSS assessment
```
```
 Cost and difficulty of implementing and maintaining PCI DSS controls
```
```
 Risk to an organization relative to payment card account data (reduced by consolidating that data into fewer, more controlled locations)
```
```
Without adequate segmentation (sometimes called a "flat network"), the entire network is in scope for the PCI DSS assessment. Segmentation
can be achieved using a number of physical or logical methods, such as properly configured internal network security controls, routers with
strong access control lists, or other technologies that restrict access to a particular segment of a network. To be considered out of scope for
PCI DSS, a system component must be properly segmented (isolated) from the CDE, such that the out-of-scope system component could not
impact the security of the CDE, even if that component was compromised.
```
```
An important prerequisite to reduce the scope of the CDE is a clear understanding of business needs and processes related to the storage,
processing, and transmission of account data. Restricting account data to as few locations as possible by eliminating unnecessary data and
consolidating necessary data may require reengineering of long-standing business practices.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Documenting account data flows via a data-flow diagram helps an entity fully understand how account data comes into an organization, where
it resides within the organization, and how it traverses through various systems within the organization. Data-flow diagrams also illustrate all
locations where account data is stored, processed, and transmitted. This information supports an entity implementing segmentation and can
also support confirming that segmentation is being used to isolate the CDE from out-of-scope networks.
```
```
If segmentation is used to reduce the scope of the PCI DSS assessment, the assessor must verify that the segmentation is adequate to
reduce the scope of the assessment, as illustrated in Figure 2. At a high level, adequate segmentation isolates systems that store, process, or
transmit account data from those that do not. However, the adequacy of a specific segmentation implementation is highly variable and
depends on several factors such as a given network's configuration, the technologies deployed, and other controls that may be implemented.
```

### Wireless

```
If wireless technology is used to store, process, or transmit account data (for example, wireless point-of-sale devices), or if a wireless local
area network (WLAN) is part of or connected to the CDE, the PCI DSS requirements and testing procedures for securing wireless
environments apply and must be performed.
```
```
Rogue wireless detection must be performed per PCI DSS Requirement 11.2.1 even when wireless is not used within the CDE and the entity
has a policy that prohibits the use of wireless technology within its environment. This is because of the ease with which a wireless access
point can be attached to a network, the difficulty in detecting its presence, and the increased risk presented by unauthorized wireless devices.
```
```
Before wireless technology is implemented, an entity should carefully evaluate the need for the technology against the risk. Consider
deploying wireless technology only for non-sensitive data transmission.
```
### Encrypted Cardholder Data and Impact on PCI DSS Scope

```
Encryption of cardholder data with strong cryptography is an acceptable method of rendering the data unreadable according to PCI DSS
Requirement 3.5. However, encryption alone is generally insufficient to render the cardholder data out of scope for PCI DSS and does not
remove the need for PCI DSS in that environment. The entity’s environment is still in scope for PCI DSS due to the presence of cardholder
data. For example, for a merchant card-present environment, there is physical access to the payment cards to complete a transaction and
there may also be paper reports or receipts with cardholder data. Similarly, in merchant card-not-present environments, such as mail-
order/telephone-order and e-commerce, payment card details are provided via channels that need to be evaluated and protected according to
PCI DSS.
```
```
The following are each in scope for PCI DSS:
```
```
 Systems performing encryption and/or decryption of cardholder data, and systems performing key management functions,
```
```
 Encrypted cardholder data that is not isolated from the encryption and decryption and key management processes,
```
```
 Encrypted cardholder data that is present on a system or media that also contains the decryption key,
```
```
 Encrypted cardholder data that is present in the same environment as the decryption key,
```
```
 Encrypted cardholder data that is accessible to an entity that also has access to the decryption key.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Note : A PCI-listed P2PE solution can significantly reduce the number of PCI DSS requirements applicable to a merchant’s cardholder data
environment. However, it does not completely remove the applicability of PCI DSS in the merchant environment.
```
### Encrypted Cardholder Data and Impact to PCI DSS Scope for Third-Party Service Providers

```
Where a third-party service provider (TPSP) receives and/or stores only data encrypted by another entity, and where they do not have the
ability to decrypt the data, the TPSP may be able to consider the encrypted data out of scope if certain conditions are met. This is because
responsibility for the data generally remains with the entity, or entities, with the ability to decrypt the data or impact the security of the
encrypted data. Determining which party is responsible for specific PCI DSS controls will depend on several factors, including who has access
to the decryption keys, the role performed by each party, and the agreement between parties. Responsibilities should be clearly defined and
documented to ensure both the TPSP and the entity providing the encrypted data understand which entity is responsible for which security
controls.
```
```
As an example, a TPSP providing storage services receives and stores encrypted cardholder data provided by customers for back-up
purposes. This TPSP does not have access to the encryption or decryption keys, nor does it perform any key management for its customers.
The TPSP can exclude any such encrypted data when determining its PCI DSS scope. However, the TPSP does maintain responsibility for
controlling access to the encrypted data storage as part of its service agreements with its customers.
```
```
Responsibility for ensuring that the encrypted data and the cryptographic keys are protected according to applicable PCI DSS requirements is
often shared between entities. In the above example, the customer determines which of their personnel are authorized to access the storage
media, and the storage facility is responsible for managing the physical and/or logical access controls to ensure that only persons authorized
by the customer are granted access to the storage media. The specific PCI DSS requirements applicable to a TPSP will depend on the
services provided and the agreement between the two parties. In the example of a TPSP providing storage services, the physical and logical
access controls provided by the TPSP will need to be reviewed at least annually. This review could be performed as part of the merchant’s
PCI DSS assessment or, alternatively, the review could be performed, and controls validated, by the TPSP with appropriate evidence provided
to the merchant. For information about “appropriate evidence,” see Options for TPSPs to Validate PCI DSS Compliance for TPSP Services
that Meet Customers’ PCI DSS Requirements.
```
```
As another example, a TPSP that receives only encrypted cardholder data for the purposes of routing to other entities, and that does not have
access to the data or cryptographic keys, may not have any PCI DSS responsibility for that encrypted data. In this scenario, where the TPSP
is not providing any security services or access controls, they may be considered the same as a public or untrusted network, and it would be
the responsibility of the entity(s) sending/receiving account data through the TPSP’s network to ensure PCI DSS controls are applied to
protect the data being transmitted.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

### Use of Third-Party Service Providers

```
An entity (referred to as the “customer” in this section) might choose to use a third-party service provider (TPSP) to store, process, or transmit
account data or to manage in-scope system components on the customer’s behalf. Use of a TPSP may have an impact on the security of a
customer’s CDE.
```
```
Note : Use of a PCI DSS compliant TPSP does not make a customer PCI DSS compliant, nor does it remove the customer’s responsibility for
its own PCI DSS compliance. Even if a customer uses a TPSP to meet all account data functions, that customer remains responsible for
confirming its own compliance as requested by organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment brands and
acquirers). Customers should contact the organizations of interest for any requirements.
```
**_Using TPSPs and the Impact on Customers Meeting PCI DSS Requirement 12._**

```
There are many different scenarios where a customer might use one or more TPSPs for functions within or related to the customer’s
CDE. In all scenarios where a TPSP is used, the customer must manage and oversee the PCI DSS compliance status of all their TPSPs
in accordance with Requirement 12.8, including TPSPs that:
```
```
 Have access to the customer’s CDE,
```
```
 Manage in-scope system components on the customer’s behalf, and/or
```
```
 Can impact the security of the customer’s CDE.
```
```
Managing TPSPs in accordance with Requirement 12.8 includes performing due diligence, having appropriate agreements in place,
identifying which requirements apply to the customer and which apply to the TPSP, and monitoring the compliance status of TPSPs at
least annually.
```
```
Requirement 12.8 does not specify that the customer’s TPSPs must be PCI DSS compliant, only that the customer monitor their
compliance status as specified in the requirement. Therefore, a TPSP does not need to be PCI DSS compliant for its customer to meet
Requirement 12.8.
```
**_Impact of Using TPSPs for Services that Meet Customers’ PCI DSS Requirements_**

```
When the TPSP provides a service that meets a PCI DSS requirement(s) on the customer’s behalf or where that service may impact the
security of the customer’s CDE, then those requirements are in scope for the customer’s assessment and the compliance of that service
will impact the customer’s PCI DSS compliance. The TPSP must demonstrate it meets applicable PCI DSS requirements for those
requirements to be in place for its customers. For example, if an entity engages a TPSP to manage its network security controls, and the
TPSP does not provide evidence that it meets the applicable requirements in PCI DSS Requirement 1, then those requirements are not
in place for the customer’s assessment. As another example, TPSPs that store backups of cardholder data on behalf of customers
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
would need to meet the applicable requirements related to access controls, physical security, etc., for their customers to consider those
requirements in place for their assessments.
```
**_Importance of Understanding Responsibilities Between TPSP Customers and TPSPs_**

```
Customers and TPSPs should clearly identify and understand the following:
```
```
 The services and system components included in the scope of the TPSP’s PCI DSS assessment,
```
```
 The specific PCI DSS requirements and sub-requirements covered by the TPSP’s PCI DSS assessment,
```
```
 Any requirements that are the responsibility of the TPSP’s customers to include in their own PCI DSS assessments, and
```
```
 Any PCI DSS requirements for which the responsibility is shared between the TPSP and its customers.
```
```
For example, a cloud provider should clearly define which of its IP addresses are scanned as part of its quarterly vulnerability scan
process and which IP addresses are their customers’ responsibility to scan.
```
```
Per Requirement 12.9.2, TPSPs are required to support their customers’ requests for information about the TPSP’s PCI DSS
compliance status related to the services provided to customers, and about which PCI DSS requirements are the responsibility of the
TPSP, which are the responsibility of the customer, and any responsibilities between the customer and the TPSP. Refer to Tips and
Tools for Understanding PCI DSS v4.0 for a responsibility matrix template that may be used for documenting and clarifying how
responsibilities are shared between TPSPs and customers.
```
**_Options for TPSPs to Validate PCI DSS Compliance for TPSP Services that Meet Customers’ PCI DSS_**

**_Requirements_**

```
TPSPs are responsible for demonstrating their PCI DSS compliance as requested by organizations that manage compliance programs
(for example, payment brands and acquirers). TPSPs should contact the organizations of interest for any requirements.
```
```
When a TPSP provides services that are intended to meet or facilitate meeting a customer’s PCI DSS requirements or that may impact
the security of a customer’s CDE, these requirements are in scope for the customer’s PCI DSS assessments. There are two options for
TPSPs to validate compliance in this scenario:
```
```
 Annual assessment : TPSP undergoes an annual PCI DSS assessment(s) and provides evidence to its customers to show the
TPSP meets the applicable PCI DSS requirements; or
```
```
 Multiple, on-demand assessments : If a TPSP does not undergo an annual PCI DSS assessment, it must undergo assessments
upon request of their customers and/or participate in each of its customers’ PCI DSS assessments, with the results of each review
provided to the respective customer(s).
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
If the TPSP undergoes its own PCI DSS assessment, it is expected to provide sufficient evidence to its customers to verify that the
scope of the TPSP’s PCI DSS assessment covered the services applicable to the customer, and that the relevant PCI DSS
requirements were examined and determined to be in place. If the provider has an PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC), it is
expected that the TPSP provides the AOC to customers upon request. The customer may also request relevant sections of the TPSP’s
PCI DSS Report on Compliance (ROC). The ROC may be redacted to protect any confidential information.
```
```
If the TPSP does not undergo its own PCI DSS assessment and therefore does not have an AOC, the TPSP is expected to provide
specific evidence related to the applicable PCI DSS requirements, so that the customer (or its assessor) is able to confirm the TPSP is
meeting those PCI DSS requirements.
```
**_TPSPs Presence on a Payment Brand List(s) of PCI DSS Compliant Service Providers_**

```
For a customer that is monitoring a TPSP’s compliance status in accordance with Requirement 12.8, the TPSP’s presence on a
payment brand’s list of PCI DSS compliant service providers may be sufficient evidence of the TPSP’s compliance status if it is clear
from the list that the services applicable to the customer were covered by the TPSP’s PCI DSS assessment. If it is not clear from the list,
the customer should obtain other written confirmation that addresses the TPSP’s PCI DSS compliance status.
```
```
For a customer that is looking for evidence of PCI DSS compliance for requirements that a TPSP meets on a customer’s behalf or
where the service provided can impact the security of the customer’s CDE, the TPSP’s presence on a payment brand’s list of PCI DSS
compliant service providers is not sufficient evidence that the applicable PCI DSS requirements for that TPSP were included in the
assessment. If the TPSP has an PCI DSS AOC, it is expected to provide it to customers upon request.

## 5 Best Practices for Implementing PCI DSS into Business-as-Usual Processes

```
An entity that implements business-as-usual processes, otherwise known as BAU, as part of their overall security strategy is taking measures
to ensure that security controls that have been implemented to secure data and an environment continue to be implemented correctly and
functioning properly as normal course of business.
```
```
Some PCI DSS requirements are intended to act as BAU processes by monitoring security controls to ensure their effectiveness on an
ongoing basis. This oversight by the entity assists with providing reasonable assurance that the compliance of its environment is preserved
between PCI DSS assessments. While there are currently some BAU requirements defined within the standard, an entity should adopt
additional BAU processes specific to their organization and environment when possible. BAU processes are a way to verify that automated
and manual controls are performing as expected. Regardless of whether a PCI DSS requirement is automated or manual, it is important for
BAU processes to detect anomalies, and alert and report so that responsible individuals address the situation in a timely manner.
```
```
Examples of how PCI DSS should be incorporated into BAU activities include but are not limited to:
```
```
 Assigning overall responsibility and accountability for PCI DSS compliance to an individual or team. This can include a charter defined
by executive management for a specific PCI DSS compliance program and communication to executive management.
```
```
 Developing performance metrics to measure the effectiveness of security initiatives and continuous monitoring of security controls,
including those that are heavily relied upon, such as network security controls, intrusion-detection systems/intrusion-prevention systems
(IDS/IPS), change-detection mechanisms, anti-malware solutions, and access controls, to ensure they are operating effectively and as
intended.
```
```
 Reviewing logged data more frequently to gain insights to trends or behaviors that may not be obvious with only monitoring.
```
```
 Ensuring that all failures in security controls are detected and responded to promptly. Processes to respond to security control failures
should include:
```
- Restoring the security control.
- Identifying the cause of failure.
- Identifying and addressing any security issues that arose during the failure of the security control.
- Implementing mitigation, such as process or technical controls, to prevent the cause of the failure from recurring.
- Resuming monitoring of the security control, perhaps with enhanced monitoring for a period of time, to verify the control is operating
    effectively.

```
 Reviewing changes that could introduce security risks to the environment (for example, addition of new systems, changes in system or
network configurations) prior to completing the change, and including the following:
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

- Perform a risk assessment to determine the potential impact to PCI DSS scope (for example, a new network security control rule
    that permits connectivity between a system in the CDE and another system could bring additional systems or networks into scope
    for PCI DSS).
- Identify PCI DSS requirements applicable to systems and networks affected by the changes (for example, if a new system is in
    scope for PCI DSS, it would need to be configured per system configuration standards, including change-detection mechanisms,
    anti -malware software, patches, and audit logging. These new systems and networks would need to be added to the inventory of in-
    scope system components and to the quarterly vulnerability scan schedule).
- Update PCI DSS scope and implement security controls as appropriate.
- Update documentation to reflect implemented changes.

```
 Reviewing the impact to PCI DSS scope and requirements upon changes to organizational structure (for example, a company merger or
acquisition).
```
```
 Reviewing external connections and third-party access periodically.
```
```
 For entities that use third parties for software development, periodically confirming that those software development activities continue to
comply with software development requirements in Requirement 6.
```
```
 Performing periodic reviews to confirm that PCI DSS requirements continue to be in place and personnel follow established processes.
Periodic reviews should cover all facilities and locations, including retail outlets and data centers, whether self-managed or if a TPSP is
used. For example, periodic reviews can be used to confirm that configuration standards have been applied to applicable systems,
default vendor accounts and passwords are removed or disabled, patches and anti-malware solutions are up to date, audit logs are
being reviewed, and so on. The frequency of periodic reviews should be determined by the entity as appropriate for the size and
complexity of their environment, if not otherwise stated in PCI DSS.
```
```
These reviews can also be used to verify that required evidence for a PCI DSS assessment is being maintained. For example, evidence of
audit logs, vulnerability scan reports, and reviews of network security control rulesets are necessary to assist the entity in preparing for its next
PCI DSS assessment.
```
```
 Establishing communication with all impacted parties, both external and internal, about newly identified threats and changes to the
organization structure. Communication materials should help recipients understand the impact of threats, mitigating steps, and contact
points for further information or escalation.
```
```
 Reviewing hardware and software technologies at least once every 12 months to confirm that they continue to be supported by the
vendor and can meet the entity’s security requirements, including PCI DSS. If technologies are no longer supported by the vendor or
cannot meet the entity’s security needs, the entity should prepare a remediation plan, including replacement of the technology, as
necessary.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Note : Some best practices in this section are also included as PCI DSS requirements for certain entities. For example, those undergoing a full
PCI DSS assessment, service providers validating to the additional “service provider only” requirements, and designated entities that are
required to validate according to Appendix A3: Designated Entities Supplemental Validation.
```
```
Each entity should consider implementing these best practices into their environment, even if the entity is not required to validate to them (for
example, merchants undergoing self-assessment).
```
```

## 6 For Assessors: Sampling for PCI DSS Assessments......................................................................................................................................

```
Sampling is an option for assessors conducting PCI DSS assessments to facilitate the assessment process when there are large numbers of
items in a population being tested.
```
```
While it is acceptable for an assessor to sample from similar items in a population being tested as part of its review of an entity’s PCI DSS
compliance, it is not acceptable for an entity to apply PCI DSS requirements to only a sample of its environment (for example, requirements for
quarterly vulnerability scans apply to all system components). Similarly, it is not acceptable for an assessor to review only a sample of PCI
DSS requirements for compliance.
```
```
While sampling allows assessors to test less than 100% of a given sampling population, assessors should always strive for the most complete
review possible. Assessors are encouraged to use automated processes or other mechanisms if the complete population, regardless of size,
can be tested quickly and efficiently with minimal impact on the resources of the entity being assessed. Where automated processes are not
available to test 100% of a population, sampling is an equally acceptable approach.
```
```
After considering the overall scope, complexity, and consistency of the environment being assessed, and the nature (automated or manual) of
the processes used by an entity to meet a requirement, the assessor may independently select representative samples from the populations
being reviewed in order to assess the entity’s compliance with PCI DSS requirements. Samples must be a representative selection of all
variants of the population and must be sufficiently large to provide the assessor with assurance that controls are implemented as expected
across the entire population. Where testing the periodic performance of a requirement (for example, weekly or quarterly, or periodically), the
assessor should attempt to select a sample that represents the entire period covered by the assessment so that the assessor may make a
reasonable judgment that the requirement was met throughout the assessment period. Testing the same sample of items year after year could
allow unknown variations in the non-sampled items to remain undetected. Assessors must revalidate the sampling rationale for each
assessment and consider previous sample sets. Different samples must be selected for each assessment.
```
```
Appropriate selection of the sample depends on what is being considered in examining the sample members. For example, determining the
presence of anti-malware on servers known to be affected by malicious software may lead to determining the population to be all servers in
the environment, or all servers in the environment that are running a particular operating system, or all servers that are not mainframes, etc.
Selection of an appropriate sample would then include representatives of ALL members of the identified population, including all servers
running the identified operating system including all versions, as well as servers within the population that are used for different functions (web
server, application servers, database servers, etc.).
```
```
In the case that a specific configuration item is being considered, the population might be appropriately divided, and separate sample groups
identified. For example, a sample of all servers may not be appropriate when reviewing an operating system configuration setting, where
different operating systems are present within the environment. In this case, samples from each operating system type would be appropriate in
identifying that the configuration has been appropriately set for each operating system. Each sample set should include servers that are
representative of each operating system type, including version, as well as representative functions.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Other examples of sampling include selections of personnel with similar or varied roles, based on the requirement being assessed, for
example, a sample of administrators vs. a sample of all employees.
```
```
The assessor is required to use professional judgment in the planning, performance, and evaluation of the sample to support their conclusion
about whether and how the entity has met a requirement. The assessor’s goal in sampling is to obtain enough evidence to have a reasonable
basis for their opinion. When independently selecting samples, assessors should consider the following:
```
```
 The assessor must select the sample from the complete population without influence from the assessed entity.
```
```
 If the entity has standardized processes and controls in place that ensure consistency and which is applied to each item in the
population, the sample can be smaller than if the entity has no standardized processes/controls in place. The sample must be large
enough to provide the assessor with reasonable assurance that items in the population adhere to the standardized processes that are
applied to each item in the population. The assessor must verify that the standardized controls are implemented and working effectively.
```
```
 If the entity has more than one type of standardized process in place (for example, for different types of business facilities/system
components), the sample must include items subject to each type of process. For example, populations could be divided into sub-
populations based on characteristics that may impact the consistency of the assessed requirements, such as the use of different
processes or tools. Samples would then be selected from each sub-population.
```
```
 If the entity has no standardized PCI DSS processes/controls in place and each item in the population is managed through non-
standardized processes, the sample must be larger for the assessor to be assured that the PCI DSS requirements are appropriately
applied to each item in the population.
```
```
 Samples of system components must include every type and combination being used. When an entity has more than one CDE, samples
must include populations across all in-scope system components. For example, where applications are sampled, the sample must
include all versions and platforms for each type of application.
```
```
 Sample sizes must always be greater than one unless there is only one item in the given population, or an automated control is used
where the assessor has confirmed the control is functioning as programmed for each assessed sample population.
```
```
 If the assessor relies on standardized processes and controls being in place as a basis for selecting a sample, but then finds out during
testing that standardized processes and controls are not in place or not operating effectively, the assessor should then increase the
sample size to attempt to gain assurance that PCI DSS requirements are being met.
```
```
For each instance where sampling is used, the assessor must:
```
```
 Document the rationale behind the sampling technique and sample size.
```
```
 Validate and document the standardized processes and controls used to determine sample size.
```
```
 Explain how the sample is appropriate and representative of the overall population.
```

Figure 3 shows considerations for determining sample size.
```
**Figure 3. PCI DSS Sampling Considerations**

```
Note : In PCI DSS v4.0, specific references to sampling have been removed from all testing procedures. These references were removed
because calling out sampling only in some testing procedures may have implied that sampling was mandatory for those testing procedures
(which it was not) or that sampling was only allowable where it was specifically mentioned. Assessors should select samples when it is
appropriate to the population being tested, and, per above, render those decisions after considering the overall scope and complexity of an
environment.

## 7 Description of Timeframes Used in PCI DSS Requirements

```
Certain PCI DSS requirements have been established with specific timeframes for activities that need to be performed consistently via a
regularly scheduled and repeatable process. The intent is that the activity is performed at an interval as close to that timeframe as possible
without exceeding it. The entity has the discretion to perform an activity more often than specified (for example, performing an activity monthly
where the PCI DSS requirement specifies it be performed every three months).
```
```
Table 4 outlines the frequency for the different time periods used in PCI DSS Requirements.

Periodically Frequency of occurrence is at the entity’s discretion and is documented and supported by the entity’s risk analysis. The entity
must demonstrate that the frequency is appropriate for the activity to be effective and to meet the intent of the requirement.

Descriptions and Examples
```
```
Significant change There are certain requirements for which performance is specified upon a significant change in an entity’s environment. While
what constitutes a significant change is highly dependent on the configuration of a given environment, each of the following
activities, at a minimum, has potential impacts on the security of the CDE and must be considered as a significant change in the
context of related PCI DSS requirements:
```
- New hardware, software, or networking equipment added to the CDE.
- Any replacement or major upgrades of hardware and software in the CDE.
- Any changes in the flow or storage of account data.
- Any changes to the boundary of the CDE and/or to the scope of the PCI DSS assessment.
- Any changes to the underlying supporting infrastructure of the CDE (including, but not limited to, changes to directory
    services, time servers, logging, and monitoring).
- Any changes to third party vendors/service providers (or services provided) that support the CDE or meet PCI DSS
    requirements on behalf of the entity.

```
For other PCI DSS requirements, where the standard does not define a minimum frequency for recurring activities but instead allows for the
requirement to be met “periodically,” the entity is expected to define the frequency as appropriate for its business. The frequency defined by
the entity must be supported by the entity’s security policy and the risk analysis conducted according to PCI DSS Requirement 12.3.1. The
entity must also be able to demonstrate that the frequency it has defined is appropriate for the activity to be effective and to meet the intent of
the requirement.
```
```
In both cases, where PCI DSS specifies a required frequency and where PCI DSS allows for “periodic” performance, the entity is expected to
have documented and implemented processes to ensure that activities are performed within a reasonable timeframe, including at least the
following:
```
```
 The entity is promptly notified any time an activity is not performed per its defined schedule,
```
```
 The entity determines the events that led to missing a scheduled activity,
```
```
 The entity performs the activity as soon as possible after it is missed and either gets back on schedule or establishes a new schedule,
```
```
 The entity produces documentation that shows the above elements occurred.
```
```
When an entity has the above processes in place to detect and address when a scheduled activity is missed, a reasonable approach is
allowable, meaning that if an activity is required to be performed at least once every three months, the entity is not automatically non-
compliant if the activity is performed late where the entity’s documented and implemented process (per above) was followed. However, where
no such process is in place and/or the activity was not performed according to schedule due to oversight, mismanagement, or lack of
monitoring, the entity has not met the requirement. In such cases, the requirement will only be in place when the entity 1) documents (or
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
reconfirms) the process per above to ensure the scheduled activity occurs on time, 2) re-establishes the schedule, and 3) provides evidence
that the entity has performed the scheduled activity at least once per their schedule.
```
```
Note : For an initial PCI DSS assessment (meaning an entity has never undergone a prior assessment), where a requirement has a defined
timeframe within which an activity is to occur, it is not required that the activity has been performed for every such timeframe during the
previous year, if the assessor verifies:
```
- _The activity was performed in accordance with the applicable requirement within the most recent timeframe (for example, the most recent_
    _three-month or six-month period), and_
- _The entity has documented policies and procedures for continuing to perform the activity within the defined timeframe._

```
For subsequent years after the initial assessment, the activity must have been performed at least once within each required timeframe. For
example, an activity required every three months must have been performed at least four times during the previous year at an interval that
does not exceed 90-92 days.
```

## 8 Approaches for Implementing and Validating PCI DSS

```
To support flexibility in how security objectives are met, there are two approaches for implementing and validating to PCI DSS. Entities should
identify the approach best suited to their security implementation and use that approach to validate the controls.
```
```
Defined Approach Follows the traditional method for implementing and validating PCI DSS and uses the Requirements and Testing
Procedures defined within the standard. In the defined approach, the entity implements security controls to meet
the stated requirements, and the assessor follows the defined testing procedures to verify that requirements
have been met.
```
```
The defined approach supports entities with controls in place that meet PCI DSS requirements as stated. This
approach may also suit entities that want more direction about how to meet security objectives, as well as
entities new to information security or PCI DSS.
```
```
Compensating Controls
```
```
As part of the defined approach, entities that cannot meet a PCI DSS
requirement explicitly as stated due to a legitimate and documented technical
or business constraint may implement other, or compensating, controls , that
sufficiently mitigate the risk associated with the requirement. On an annual
basis, any compensating controls must be documented by the entity and
reviewed and validated by the assessor and included with the Report on
Compliance submission.
```
```
Note: For more details, see
Appendix B: Compensating
Controls and Appendix C:
Compensating Controls
Worksheet.
```
```
Customized Approach Focuses on the Objective of each PCI DSS requirement (if applicable),
allowing entities to implement controls to meet the requirement’s stated
Customized Approach Objective in a way that does not strictly follow the
defined requirement. Because each customized implementation will be
different, there are no defined testing procedures; the assessor is required to
derive testing procedures that are appropriate to the specific implementation to
validate that the implemented controls meet the stated Objective.
```
```
The customized approach supports innovation in security practices, allowing entities greater flexibility to show
how their current security controls meet PCI DSS objectives. This approach is intended for risk-mature entities
that demonstrate a robust risk-management approach to security, including, but not limited to, a dedicated risk-
management department or an organization-wide risk management approach.
```
```
Note: For more details, see
Appendix D: Customized
Approach and Appendix E:
Sample Templates to
Support Customized
Approach.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
The controls implemented and validated using the customized approach are expected to meet or exceed the
security provided by the requirement in the defined approach. The level of documentation and effort required to
validate customized implementations will also be greater than for the defined approach
```
```
Most PCI DSS requirements can be met using either the defined or customized approach. However, several requirements do not have a
stated Customized Approach Objective; the customized approach is not an option for these requirements.
```
```
Entities can use both the defined and customized approaches within their environment. This means an entity could use the defined approach
to meet some requirements and use the customized approach to meet other requirements. This also means that an entity could use the
defined approach to meet a given PCI DSS requirement for one system component or within one environment and use the customized
approach to meet that same PCI DSS requirement for a different system component or within a different environment. In this way, a PCI DSS
assessment could include both defined and customized testing procedures.
```

## 9 Protecting Information About an Entity’s Security Posture

```
The processes related to becoming and maintaining a PCI DSS compliant environment results in many artifacts that an entity may consider
sensitive and may want to protect as such, including such items as the following:
```
```
 The Report on Compliance or Self-Assessment Questionnaire (the associated Attestation of Compliance is not considered sensitive and
third-party service providers (TPSPs) are expected to share their AOC with customers).
```
```
 Network diagrams and account data-flow diagrams, and security configurations and rules.
```
```
 System configuration standards.
```
```
 Cryptography and key management methods and protocols.
```
```
Entities should review all the artifacts related to PCI DSS controls or the assessment and protect them in accordance with the entity’s security
policies for this type of information.
```
```
TPSPs are required (PCI DSS Requirement 12.9) to support their customers with the following:
```
```
 Information needed for customers to monitor the TPSPs’ PCI DSS compliance status (to enable the customer to comply with
Requirement 12.8), and
```
```
 Evidence that the TPSP is meeting applicable PCI DSS requirements where the TPSP’s services are intended to meet or facilitate
meeting a customer’s PCI DSS requirements, or where those services may impact the security of a customer’s CDE.
```
```
This section does not impact or negate a TPSP’s obligation to support and provide information to their customers per Requirement 12.9.
```
```
For more details about expectations for TPSPs and relationships between TPSPs and customers, see Use of Third-Party Service Providers.
```
**_Protection of Confidential and Sensitive Information by Qualified Security Assessor Companies_**

```
Each Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) Company signs an agreement with PCI SSC that they will adhere to the Qualification Requirements
for QSAs. The Protection of Confidential and Sensitive Information section of that document includes the following:
```
```
“The QSA company must have and adhere to a documented process for protection of confidential and sensitive information. This must
include adequate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards consistent with industry-accepted practices to protect confidential and
sensitive information against any threats or unauthorized access during storage, processing, and/or communicating of this information.
```
```
The QSA Company must maintain the privacy and confidentiality of information obtained in the course of performing its duties and
obligations as a QSA Company, unless (and to the extent) disclosure is required by legal authority.”
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

## 10 Testing Methods for PCI DSS Requirements

```
The testing methods identified in the Testing Procedures for each requirement describe the expected activities to be performed by the
assessor to determine whether the entity has met the requirement. The intent behind each testing method is described as follows:
```
```
 Examine: The assessor critically evaluates data evidence. Common examples include documents (electronic or physical), screenshots,
configuration files, audit logs, and data files.
```
```
 Observe: The assessor watches an action or views something in the environment. Examples of observation subjects include personnel
performing a task or process, system components performing a function or responding to input, environmental conditions, and physical
controls.
```
```
 Interview: The assessor converses with individual personnel. Interview objectives may include confirmation of whether an activity is
performed, descriptions of how an activity is performed, and whether personnel have particular knowledge or understanding.
```
```
The testing methods are intended to allow the assessed entity to demonstrate how they have met a requirement. They also provide the
assessed entity and the assessor with a common understanding of the assessment activities to be performed. The specific items to be
examined or observed and personnel to be interviewed should be appropriate for both the requirement being assessed and each entity’s
particular implementation. When documenting the assessment results, the assessor identifies the testing activities performed and the result of
each activity.
```

## 11 Instructions and Content for Report on Compliance

Instructions and content for the Report on Compliance (ROC) are provided in the _PCI DSS Report on Compliance (ROC) Template_.

The PCI DSS Report on Compliance (ROC) Template must be used as the template for creating a PCI DSS Report on Compliance.

Whether any entity is required to comply with or validate their compliance to PCI DSS is at the discretion of those organizations that manage

compliance programs (such as payment brands and acquirers). Entities should contact the organizations of interest to determine any reporting

requirements and instructions.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

## 12 PCI DSS Assessment Process

```
The PCI DSS assessment process includes the following high-level steps:^5
```
1. Confirm the scope of the PCI DSS assessment.
2. Perform the PCI DSS assessment of the environment.
3. Complete the applicable report for the assessment according to PCI DSS guidance and instructions.
4. Complete the Attestation of Compliance for Service Providers or Merchants, as applicable, in its entirety. Official Attestations of
    Compliance are only available on the PCI SSC website.
5. Submit the applicable PCI SSC documentation and the Attestation of Compliance, along with any other requested documentation—such
    as ASV scan reports—to the requesting organization (those that manage compliance programs such as payment brands and acquirers
    (for merchants), or other requesters (for service providers)).
6. If required, perform remediation to address requirements that are not in place and provide an updated report.

```
Note: PCI DSS requirements are not considered to be in place if controls are not yet implemented or are scheduled to be completed at a
future date. After any open or not-in-place items are addressed by the entity, the assessor will reassess to validate that the remediation is
completed and that all requirements are satisfied. Refer to the following resources (available on the PCI SSC website) to document the PCI
DSS assessment:
```
- _For instructions about completing reports on compliance (ROC), refer to the PCI DSS Report on Compliance (ROC) Template._
- _For instructions about completing self-assessment questionnaires (SAQ), refer to the PCI DSS SAQ Instructions and Guidelines._
- _For instructions about submitting PCI DSS compliance validation reports, refer to the PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance._

(^5) The PCI DSS assessment process, and the roles and responsibilities for completion of each step, vary depending on the type of assessment and on compliance
programs, which are managed by payment brands and acquirers.

**_Additional Requirements for Service Providers Only_**

```
Some requirements apply only when the entity being assessed is a service provider. These are identified within the requirement as “ Additional
requirement for service providers only” and apply in addition to all other applicable requirements. Where the entity being assessed is both a
merchant and a service provider, requirements noted as “ Additional requirement for service providers only” apply to the service provider
portion of the entity’s business. Requirements identified with “ Additional requirement for service providers only” are also recommended as best
practices for consideration by all entities.

### Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems

**_Requirement 1: Install and Maintain Network Security Controls_**

```
Sections
```
```
1.1 Processes and mechanisms for installing and maintaining network security controls are defined and understood.
1.2 Network security controls (NSCs) are configured and maintained.
1.3 Network access to and from the cardholder data environment is restricted.
1.4 Network connections between trusted and untrusted networks are controlled.
1.5 Risks to the CDE from computing devices that are able to connect to both untrusted networks and the CDE are mitigated.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Overview
```
```
Network security controls (NSCs), such as firewalls and other network security technologies, are network policy enforcement points that
typically control network traffic between two or more logical or physical network segments (or subnets) based on pre-defined policies or rules.
```
```
NSCs examine all network traffic entering (ingress) and leaving (egress) a segment and decide, based on the policies defined, whether the
network traffic is allowed to pass or whether it should be rejected. Typically, NSCs are placed between environments with different security
needs or levels of trust, however in some environments NSCs control the traffic to individual devices irrespective of trust boundaries. Policy
enforcement generally occurs at layer 3 of the OSI model, but data present in higher layers is also frequently used to determine policy
decisions.
```
```
Traditionally this function has been provided by physical firewalls; however, now this functionality may be provided by virtual devices, cloud
access controls, virtualization/container systems, and other software-defined networking technology.
```
```
NSCs are used to control traffic within an entity’s own networks—for example, between highly sensitive and less sensitive areas—and also to
protect the entity’s resources from exposure to untrusted networks. The cardholder data environment (CDE) is an example of a more sensitive
area within an entity’s network. Often, seemingly insignificant paths to and from untrusted networks can provide unprotected pathways into
sensitive systems. NSCs provide a key protection mechanism for any computer network.
```
```
Common examples of untrusted networks include the Internet, dedicated connections such as business-to-business communication channels,
wireless networks, carrier networks (such as cellular), third-party networks, and other sources outside the entity’s ability to control. Furthermore,
untrusted networks also include corporate networks that are considered out-of-scope for PCI DSS, because they are not assessed, and
therefore must be treated as untrusted because the existence of security controls has not been verified. While an entity may consider an
internal network to be trusted from an infrastructure perspective, if a network is out of scope for PCI DSS, that network must be considered
untrusted for PCI DSS.
```
```
Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
1.1 Processes and mechanisms for installing and maintaining network security controls are defined and understood.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 1.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 1.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 1, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For these
reasons, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives.
```
```
1.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 1 are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```
1.1.1 Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that security policies and
operational procedures identified in Requirement 1
are managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting
activities within Requirement 1 are defined,
understood, and adhered to by affected personnel.
All supporting activities are repeatable, consistently
applied, and conform to management’s intent.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
1.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing
activities in Requirement 1 are documented,
assigned, and understood.
```
```
1.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that
descriptions of roles and responsibilities for
performing activities in Requirement 1 are
documented and assigned.
```
```
1.1.2.b Interview personnel responsible for
performing activities in Requirement 1 to verify that
roles and responsibilities are assigned as
documented and are understood.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the
activities in Requirement 1 are allocated. Personnel
are accountable for successful, continuous
operation of these requirements.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
1.2 Network security controls (NSCs) are configured and maintained.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The implementation of these configuration
standards results in the NSC being configured
and managed to properly perform their security
function (often referred to as the ruleset).
Good Practice
These standards often define the requirements for
acceptable protocols, ports that are permitted to
be used, and specific configuration requirements
that are acceptable. Configuration standards may
also outline what the entity considers not
acceptable or not permitted within its network.
Definitions
NSCs are key components of a network
architecture. Most commonly, NSCs are used at
the boundaries of the CDE to control network
traffic flowing inbound and outbound from the
CDE.
Configuration standards outline an entity’s
minimum requirements for the configuration of its
NSCs
Examples
Examples of NSCs covered by these
configuration standards include, but are not
limited to, firewalls, routers configured with
access control lists, and cloud virtual networks.
```
```
1.2.1 Configuration standards for NSC rulesets are:
```
- Defined.
- Implemented.
- Maintained.

```
1.2.1.a Examine the configuration standards for
NSC rulesets to verify the standards are in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
1.2.1.b Examine configuration settings for NSC
rulesets to verify that rulesets are implemented
according to the configuration standards.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The way that NSCs are configured and operate are
defined and consistently applied.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Good Practice^
Changes should be approved by individuals with
the appropriate authority and knowledge to
understand the impact of the change. Verification
should provide reasonable assurance that the
change did not adversely impact the security of
the network and that the change performs as
expected.
To avoid having to address security issues
introduced by a change, all changes should be
approved prior to being implemented and verified
after the change is implemented. Once approved
and verified, network documentation should be
updated to include the changes to prevent
inconsistencies between network documentation
and the actual configuration.
```
```
1.2.2 All changes to network connections and to
configurations of NSCs are approved and managed
in accordance with the change control process
defined at Requirement 6.5.1.
```
```
1.2.2.a Examine documented procedures to verify
that changes to network connections and
configurations of NSCs are included in the formal
change control process in accordance with
Requirement 6.5.1.
```
```
1.2.2.b Examine network configuration settings to
identify changes made to network connections.
Interview responsible personnel and examine
change control records to verify that identified
changes to network connections were approved
and managed in accordance with Requirement
6.5.1.
```
```
1.2.2.c Examine network configuration settings to
identify changes made to configurations of NSCs.
Interview responsible personnel and examine

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Maintaining an accurate and up-to-date network
diagram(s) prevents network connections and
devices from being overlooked and unknowingly
left unsecured and vulnerable to compromise.
A properly maintained network diagram(s) helps
an organization verify its PCI DSS scope by
identifying systems connecting to and from the
CDE.
Good Practice
All connections to and from the CDE should be
identified, including systems providing security,
management, or maintenance services to CDE
system components. Entities should consider
including the following in their network diagrams:
```
- All locations, including retail locations, data
    centers, corporate locations, cloud providers,
    etc.
- Clear labeling of all network segments.
- All security controls providing segmentation,
    including unique identifiers for each control
    (for example, name of control, make, model,
    and version).
- All in-scope system components, including
    NSCs, web app firewalls, anti-malware
    solutions, change management solutions,
    IDS/IPS, log aggregation systems, payment
    terminals, payment applications, HSMs, etc.
- Clear labeling of any out-of-scope areas on
    the diagram via a shaded box or other
    mechanism.
- Date of last update, and names of people that
    made and approved the updates.
- A legend or key to explain the diagram.
Diagrams should be updated by authorized
personnel to ensure diagrams continue to provide
an accurate description of the network.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
An up-to-date, readily available data-flow diagram
helps an organization understand and keep track
of the scope of its environment by showing how
account data flows across networks and between
individual systems and devices.
Maintaining an up-to-date data-flow diagram(s)
prevents account data from being overlooked and
unknowingly left unsecured.
Good Practice
The data-flow diagram should include all
connection points where account data is received
into and sent out of the network, including
connections to open, public networks, application
processing flows, storage, transmissions between
systems and networks, and file backups.
The data-flow diagram is meant to be in addition
to the network diagram and should reconcile with
and augment the network diagram. As a best
practice, entities can consider including the
following in their data-flow diagrams:
```
- All processing flows of account data, including
    authorization, capture, settlement,
    chargeback, and refunds.
- All distinct acceptance channels, including
    card-present, card-not-present, and e-
    commerce.
- All types of data receipt or transmission,
    including any involving hard copy/paper
    media.
- The flow of account data from the point where
    it enters the environment, to its final
    disposition.
- Where account data is transmitted and
    processed, where it is stored, and whether
    storage is short term or long term.

entities with which account data is shared.

- Date of last update, and names of people that
    made and approved the updates.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Compromises often happen due to unused or
insecure services (for example, telnet and FTP),
protocols, and ports, since these can lead to
unnecessary points of access being opened into
the CDE. Additionally, services, protocols, and
ports that are enabled but not in use are often
overlooked and left unsecured and unpatched. By
identifying the services, protocols, and ports
necessary for business, entities can ensure that
all other services, protocols, and ports are
disabled or removed.
Good Practice
The security risk associated with each service,
protocol, and port allowed should be understood.
Approvals should be granted by personnel
independent of those managing the configuration.
Approving personnel should possess knowledge
and accountability appropriate for making
approval decisions.
```
```
1.2.5 All services, protocols, and ports allowed are
identified, approved, and have a defined business
need.
```
```
1.2.5.a Examine documentation to verify that a list
exists of all allowed services, protocols, and ports,
including business justification and approval for
each.

1.2.5.b Examine configuration settings for NSCs to
verify that only approved services, protocols, and
Customized Approach Objective ports are in use.^

```
Unauthorized network traffic (services, protocols, or
packets destined for specific ports) cannot enter or
leave the network.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Compromises take advantage of insecure
network configurations.
Good Practice
If insecure services, protocols, or ports are
necessary for business, the risk posed by these
services, protocols, and ports should be clearly
understood and accepted by the organization, the
use of the service, protocol, or port should be
justified, and the security features that mitigate
the risk of using these services, protocols, and
ports should be defined and implemented by the
entity.
Further Information
For guidance on services, protocols, or ports
considered to be insecure, refer to industry
standards and guidance (for example, from NIST,
ENISA, OWASP).
```
```
1.2.6 Security features are defined and
implemented for all services, protocols, and ports
that are in use and considered to be insecure, such
that the risk is mitigated.
```
```
1.2.6.a Examine documentation that identifies all
insecure services, protocols, and ports in use to
verify that for each, security features are defined to
mitigate the risk.
```
```
1.2.6.b Examine configuration settings for NSCs to
verify that the defined security features are
implemented for each identified insecure service,
protocol, and port.

The specific risks associated with the use of
insecure services, protocols, and ports are
understood, assessed, and appropriately mitigated.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Such a review gives the organization an
opportunity to clean up any unneeded, outdated,
or incorrect rules and configurations which could
be utilized by an unauthorized person.
Furthermore, it ensures that all rules and
configurations allow only authorized services,
protocols, and ports that match the documented
business justifications.
Good Practice
This review, which can be implemented using
manual, automated, or system-based methods, is
intended to confirm that the settings that manage
traffic rules, what is allowed in and out of the
network, match the approved configurations.
The review should provide confirmation that all
permitted access has a justified business reason.
Any discrepancies or uncertainties about a rule or
configuration should be escalated for resolution.
While this requirement specifies that this review
occur at least once every six months,
organizations with a high volume of changes to
their network configurations may wish to consider
performing reviews more frequently to ensure that
the configurations continue to meet the needs of
the business.
```
```
1.2.7 Configurations of NSCs are reviewed at least
once every six months to confirm they are relevant
and effective.
```
```
1.2.7.a Examine documentation to verify
procedures are defined for reviewing
configurations of NSCs at least once every six
months.
```
```
1.2.7.b Examine documentation of reviews of
configurations for NSCs and interview responsible
personnel to verify that reviews occur at least once
every six months.
```
```
1.2.7.c Examine configurations for NSCs to verify
that configurations identified as no longer being
supported by a business justification are removed
or updated.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
NSC configurations that allow or restrict access to
trusted networks are verified periodically to ensure
that only authorized connections with a current
business justification are permitted.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
To prevent unauthorized configurations from
being applied to the network, stored files with
configurations for network controls need to be
kept up to date and secured against unauthorized
changes.
Keeping configuration information current and
secure ensures that the correct settings for NSCs
are applied whenever the configuration is run.
Examples
If the secure configuration for a router is stored in
non-volatile memory, when that router is restarted
or rebooted, these controls should ensure that its
secure configuration is reinstated.
```
```
1.2.8 Configuration files for NSCs are:
```
- Secured from unauthorized access.
- Kept consistent with active network
    configurations.

```
1.2.8 Examine configuration files for NSCs to verify
they are in accordance with all elements specified
in this requirement.
```

```
NSCs cannot be defined or modified using untrusted
configuration objects (including files).
```
```
Applicability Notes

1.3 Network access to and from the cardholder data environment is restricted.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
This requirement aims to prevent malicious
individuals from accessing the entity’s network via
unauthorized IP addresses or from using
services, protocols, or ports in an unauthorized
manner.
Good Practice
All traffic inbound to the CDE, regardless of where
it originates, should be evaluated to ensure it
follows established, authorized rules. Connections
should be inspected to ensure traffic is restricted
to only authorized communications—for example,
by restricting source/destination addresses and
ports, and blocking of content.
Examples
Implementing a rule that denies all inbound and
outbound traffic that is not specifically needed—
for example, by using an explicit “deny all” or
implicit deny after allow statement—helps to
prevent inadvertent holes that would allow
unintended and potentially harmful traffic.
```
```
1.3.1 Inbound traffic to the CDE is restricted as
follows:
```
- To only traffic that is necessary.
- All other traffic is specifically denied.

to verify that they define restricting inbound traffic
to the CDE is in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.

This requirement aims to prevent malicious
individuals and compromised system components
within the entity’s network from communicating
with an untrusted external host.
Good Practice
All traffic outbound from the CDE, regardless of
the destination, should be evaluated to ensure it
follows established, authorized rules. Connections
should be inspected to restrict traffic to only
authorized communications—for example, by
restricting source/destination addresses and

1.3.2.b Examine configurations of NSCs to verify
that outbound traffic from the CDE is restricted in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Unauthorized traffic cannot leave the CDE.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The known (or unknown) implementation and
exploitation of wireless technology within a
network is a common path for malicious
individuals to gain access to the network and
account data. If a wireless device or network is
installed without the entity’s knowledge, a
malicious individual could easily and “invisibly”
enter the network. If NSCs do not restrict access
from wireless networks into the CDE, malicious
individuals that gain unauthorized access to the
wireless network can easily connect to the CDE
and compromise account information.
```
```
1.3.3 NSCs are installed between all wireless
networks and the CDE, regardless of whether the
wireless network is a CDE, such that:
```
- All wireless traffic from wireless networks into the
    CDE is denied by default.
- Only wireless traffic with an authorized business
    purpose is allowed into the CDE.

```
1.3.3 Examine configuration settings and network
diagrams to verify that NSCs are implemented
between all wireless networks and the CDE, in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```

Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Unauthorized traffic cannot traverse network
boundaries between any wireless networks and
wired environments in the CDE.

1.4 Network connections between trusted and untrusted networks are controlled.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Implementing NSCs at every connection coming
into and out of trusted networks allows the entity
to monitor and control access and minimizes the
chances of a malicious individual obtaining
access to the internal network via an unprotected
connection.
Examples
An entity could implement a DMZ, which is a part
of the network that manages connections
between an untrusted network (for examples of
untrusted networks refer to the Requirement 1
Overview) and services that an organization
needs to have available to the public, such as a
web server. Please note that if an entity’s DMZ
processes or transmits account data (for example,
e-commerce website), it is also considered a
CDE.
```
```
1.4.1 NSCs are implemented between trusted and
untrusted networks.
```
```
1.4.1.a Examine configuration standards and
network diagrams to verify that NSCs are defined
between trusted and untrusted networks.
```
```
1.4.1.b Examine network configurations to verify
that NSCs are in place between trusted and
untrusted networks, in accordance with the
documented configuration standards and network
diagrams.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Unauthorized traffic cannot traverse network
boundaries between trusted and untrusted
networks.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Ensuring that public access to a system
component is specifically authorized reduces the
risk of system components being unnecessarily
exposed to untrusted networks.
Good Practice
System components that provide publicly
accessible services, such as email, web, and
DNS servers, are the most vulnerable to threats
originating from untrusted networks.
Ideally, such systems are placed within a
dedicated trusted network that is public facing (for
example, a DMZ) but that is separated via NSCs
from more sensitive internal systems, which helps
protect the rest of the network in the event these
externally accessible systems are compromised.
This functionality is intended to prevent malicious
actors from accessing the organization's internal
network from the Internet, or from using services,
protocols, or ports in an unauthorized manner.
Where this functionality is provided as a built-in
feature of an NSC, the entity should ensure that
its configurations do not result in the functionality
being disabled or bypassed.
Definitions
Maintaining the "state" (or status) for each
connection into a network means the NSC
“knows” whether an apparent response to a
previous connection is a valid, authorized
response (since the NSC retains each
connection’s status) or whether it is malicious
traffic trying to fool the NSC into allowing the
connection.
```
```
1.4.2 Inbound traffic from untrusted networks to
trusted networks is restricted to:
```
- Communications with system components that
    are authorized to provide publicly accessible
    services, protocols, and ports.
- Stateful responses to communications initiated
    by system components in a trusted network.
- All other traffic is denied.

```
1.4.2 Examine vendor documentation and
configurations of NSCs to verify that inbound traffic
from untrusted networks to trusted networks is
restricted in accordance with all elements specified
in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Only traffic that is authorized or that is a response to
a system component in the trusted network can
enter a trusted network from an untrusted network.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
The intent of this requirement is to address
communication sessions between trusted and
untrusted networks, rather than the specifics of
protocols.
This requirement does not limit the use of UDP or
other connectionless network protocols if state is
maintained by the NSC.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Filtering packets coming into the trusted network
helps to, among other things, ensure packets are
not “spoofed” to appear as if they are coming from
an organization’s own internal network. For
example, anti-spoofing measures prevent internal
addresses originating from the Internet from
passing into the DMZ.
Good Practice
Products usually come with anti-spoofing set as a
default and may not be configurable. Entities
should consult the vendor's documentation for
more information.
Examples
Normally, a packet contains the IP address of the
computer that originally sent it so other computers
in the network know where the packet originated.
Malicious individuals will often try to spoof (or
imitate) the sending IP address to fool the target
system into believing the packet is from a trusted
source.
```
```
1.4.3 Anti-spoofing measures are implemented to
detect and block forged source IP addresses from
entering the trusted network.
```
```
1.4.3 Examine vendor documentation and
configurations for NSCs to verify that anti-spoofing
measures are implemented to detect and block
forged source IP addresses from entering the

Packets with forged IP source addresses cannot
enter a trusted network.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Cardholder data that is directly accessible from an
untrusted network, for example, because it is
stored on a system within the DMZ or in a cloud
database service, is easier for an external
attacker to access because there are fewer
defensive layers to penetrate. Using NSCs to
ensure that system components that store
cardholder data (such as a database or a file) can
only be directly accessed from trusted networks
can prevent unauthorized network traffic from
reaching the system component.
```
```
1.4.4 System components that store cardholder
data are not directly accessible from untrusted
networks.
```
```
1.4.4.a Examine the data-flow diagram and
network diagram to verify that it is documented that
system components storing cardholder data are
not directly accessible from the untrusted
networks.
```
```
1.4.4.b Examine configurations of NSCs to verify
that controls are implemented such that system
components storing cardholder data are not
directly accessible from untrusted networks.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Stored cardholder data cannot be accessed from
untrusted networks.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is not intended to apply to storage
of account data in volatile memory but does apply
where memory is being treated as persistent
storage (for example, RAM disk). Account data can
only be stored in volatile memory during the time
necessary to support the associated business
process (for example, until completion of the related
payment card transaction).

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Restricting the disclosure of internal, private, and
local IP addresses is useful to prevent a hacker
from obtaining knowledge of these IP addresses
and using that information to access the network.
Good Practice
Methods used to meet the intent of this
requirement may vary, depending on the specific
networking technology being used. For example,
the controls used to meet this requirement may
be different for IPv4 networks than for IPv6
networks.
Examples
Methods to obscure IP addressing may include,
but are not limited to:
```
- IPv4 Network Address Translation (NAT).
- Placing system components behind proxy
    servers/NSCs.
- Removal or filtering of route advertisements
    for internal networks that use registered
    addressing.
- Internal use of RFC 1918 (IPv4) or use IPv6
    privacy extension (RFC 4941) when initiating
    outgoing sessions to the internet.

1.5 Risks to the CDE from computing devices that are able to connect to both untrusted networks and the CDE are mitigated.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Computing devices that are allowed to connect to
the Internet from outside the corporate
environment—for example, desktops, laptops,
tablets, smartphones, and other mobile computing
devices used by employees—are more vulnerable
to Internet-based threats.
Use of security controls such as host-based
controls (for example, personal firewall software
or end-point protection solutions), network-based
security controls (for example, firewalls, network-
based heuristics inspection, and malware
simulation), or hardware, helps to protect devices
from Internet-based attacks, which could use the
device to gain access to the organization’s
systems and data when the device reconnects to
the network.
```
```
(continued on next page)
```
```
1.5.1 Security controls are implemented on any
computing devices, including company- and
employee-owned devices, that connect to both
untrusted networks (including the Internet) and the
CDE as follows:
```
- Specific configuration settings are defined to
    prevent threats being introduced into the
    entity’s network.
- Security controls are actively running.
- Security controls are not alterable by users of
    the computing devices unless specifically
    documented and authorized by management on
    a case-by-case basis for a limited period.

```
1.5.1.a Examine policies and configuration
standards and interview personnel to verify
security controls for computing devices that
connect to both untrusted networks, and the CDE,
are implemented in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
1.5.1.b Examine configuration settings on
computing devices that connect to both untrusted
networks and the CDE to verify settings are
implemented in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Devices that connect to untrusted environments and
also connect to the CDE cannot introduce threats to
the entity’s CDE.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Applicability Notes Good Practice^
The specific configuration settings are determined
by the entity and should be consistent with its
network security policies and procedures.
Where there is a legitimate need to temporarily
disable security controls on a company-owned or
employee-owned device that connects to both an
untrusted network and the CDE—for example, to
support a specific maintenance activity or
investigation of a technical problem—the reason
for taking such action is understood and approved
by an appropriate management representative.
Any disabling or altering of these security
controls, including on administrators’ own
devices, is performed by authorized personnel.
It is recognized that administrators have privileges
that may allow them to disable security controls
on their own computers, but there should be
alerting mechanisms in place when such controls
are disabled and follow up that occurs to ensure
processes were followed.
Examples
Practices include forbidding split-tunneling of
VPNs for employee-owned or corporate-owned
mobile devices and requiring that such devices
boot up into a VPN.
```
```
These security controls may be temporarily disabled
only if there is legitimate technical need, as
authorized by management on a case-by-case
basis. If these security controls need to be disabled
for a specific purpose, it must be formally
authorized. Additional security measures may also
need to be implemented for the period during which
these security controls are not active.
This requirement applies to employee-owned and
company-owned computing devices. Systems that
cannot be managed by corporate policy introduce
weaknesses and provide opportunities that
malicious individuals may exploit.

2.1 Processes and mechanisms for applying secure configurations to all system components are defined and understood.
2.2 System components are configured and managed securely.
2.3 Wireless environments are configured and managed securely.
```

Overview
```
```
Malicious individuals, both external and internal to an entity, often use default passwords and other vendor default settings to compromise
systems. These passwords and settings are well known and are easily determined via public information.
```
```
Applying secure configurations to system components reduces the means available to an attacker to compromise the system. Changing default
passwords, removing unnecessary software, functions, and accounts, and disabling or removing unnecessary services all help to reduce the
potential attack surface.

```
2.1 Processes and mechanisms for applying secure configurations to all system components are defined and understood.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 2.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 2.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 2, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles.
Operational procedures describe how to perform
activities, and define the controls, methods, and
processes that are followed to achieve the
desired result in a consistent manner and in
accordance with policy objectives.
```
```
2.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 2 are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```
2.1.1 Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that security policies and
operational procedures identified in Requirement 2
are managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting
activities within Requirement 2 are defined and
adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting
activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and
conform to management’s intent.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
2.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing
activities in Requirement 2 are documented,
assigned, and understood.
```
```
2.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that
descriptions of roles and responsibilities for
performing activities in Requirement 2 are
documented and assigned.
```
```
2.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility for
performing activities in Requirement 2 to verify that
roles and responsibilities are assigned as
documented and are understood.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the
activities in Requirement 2 are allocated. Personnel
are accountable for successful, continuous
operation of these requirements.
```

```
2.2 System components are configured and managed securely.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
There are known weaknesses with many
operating systems, databases, network devices,
software, applications, container images, and
other devices used by an entity or within an
entity’s environment. There are also known ways
to configure these system components to fix
security vulnerabilities. Fixing security
vulnerabilities reduces the opportunities available
to an attacker.
By developing standards, entities ensure their
system components will be configured
consistently and securely, and address the
protection of devices for which full hardening may
be more difficult.
Good Practice
Keeping up to date with current industry guidance
will help the entity maintain secure configurations.
The specific controls to be applied to a system will
vary and should be appropriate for the type and
function of the system.
Numerous security organizations have
established system-hardening guidelines and
recommendations, which advise how to correct
common, known weaknesses.
Further Information
Sources for guidance on configuration standards
include but are not limited to: Center for Internet
Security (CIS), International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), Cloud
Security Alliance, and product vendors.
```
```
2.2.1 Configuration standards are developed,
implemented, and maintained to:
```
- Cover all system components.
- Address all known security vulnerabilities.
- Be consistent with industry-accepted system
    hardening standards or vendor hardening
    recommendations.
- Be updated as new vulnerability issues are
    identified, as defined in Requirement 6.3.1.
- Be applied when new systems are configured
    and verified as in place before or immediately
    after a system component is connected to a
    production environment.

```
2.2.1.a Examine system configuration standards
to verify they define processes that include all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
2.2.1.b Examine policies and procedures and
interview personnel to verify that system
configuration standards are updated as new
vulnerability issues are identified, as defined in
Requirement 6.3.1.
```
```
2.2.1.c Examine configuration settings and
interview personnel to verify that system
configuration standards are applied when new
systems are configured and verified as being in
place before or immediately after a system
component is connected to a production
environment.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
All system components are configured securely and
consistently and in accordance with industry-
accepted hardening standards or vendor
recommendations.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Malicious individuals often use vendor default
account names and passwords to compromise
operating systems, applications, and the systems
on which they are installed. Because these
default settings are often published and are well
known, changing these settings will make
systems less vulnerable to attack.
Good Practice
All vendor default accounts should be identified,
and their purpose and use understood. It is
important to establish controls for application and
system accounts, including those used to deploy
and maintain cloud services so that they do not
use default passwords and are not usable by
unauthorized individuals.
Where a default account is not intended to be
used, changing the default password to a unique
password that meets PCI DSS Requirement
8.3.6, removing any access to the default
account, and then disabling the account, will
prevent a malicious individual from re-enabling
the account and gaining access with the default
password.
Using an isolated staging network to install and
configure new systems is recommended and can
also be used to confirm that default credentials
have not been introduced into production
environments.
Examples
Defaults to be considered include user IDs,
passwords, and other authentication credentials
commonly used by vendors in their products.
```
```
2.2.2 Vendor default accounts are managed as
follows:
```
- If the vendor default account(s) will be used, the
    default password is changed per Requirement
    8.3.6.
- If the vendor default account(s) will not be used,
    the account is removed or disabled.

```
2.2.2.a Examine system configuration standards to
verify they include managing vendor default
accounts in accordance with all elements specified
in this requirement.
```
```
2.2.2.b Examine vendor documentation and
observe a system administrator logging on using
vendor default accounts to verify accounts are
implemented in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
2.2.2.c Examine configuration files and interview
personnel to verify that all vendor default accounts
Customized Approach Objective that will not be used are removed or disabled.^
```
```
System components cannot be accessed using
default passwords.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This applies to ALL vendor default accounts and
passwords, including, but not limited to, those used
by operating systems, software that provides
security services, application and system accounts,
point-of-sale (POS) terminals, payment applications,
and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
defaults.
This requirement also applies where a system
component is not installed within an entity’s
environment, for example, software and applications
that are part of the CDE and are accessed via a
cloud subscription service.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Systems containing a combination of services,
protocols, and daemons for their primary function
will have a security profile appropriate to allow
that function to operate effectively. For example,
systems that need to be directly connected to the
Internet would have a particular profile, like a
DNS server, web server, or an e-commerce
server. Conversely, other system components
may operate a primary function comprising a
different set of services, protocols, and daemons
that performs functions that an entity does not
want exposed to the Internet. This requirement
aims to ensure that different functions do not
impact the security profiles of other services in a
way which may cause them to operate at a higher
or lower security level.
Good Practice
Ideally, each function should be placed on
different system components. This can be
achieved by implementing only one primary
function on each system component. Another
option is to isolate primary functions on the same
system component that have different security
levels, for example, isolating web servers (which
need to be directly connected to the Internet) from
application and database servers.
(continued on next page)
```
```
2.2.3 Primary functions requiring different security
levels are managed as follows:
```
- Only one primary function exists on a system
    component,
**OR**
- Primary functions with differing security levels
    that exist on the same system component are
    isolated from each other,
**OR**
- Primary functions with differing security levels on
    the same system component are all secured to
    the level required by the function with the highest
    security need.

```
2.2.3.a Examine system configuration standards to
verify they include managing primary functions
requiring different security levels as specified in
this requirement.
```
```
2.2.3.b Examine system configurations to verify
that primary functions requiring different security
levels are managed per one of the ways specified
in this requirement.
```
```
2.2.3.c Where virtualization technologies are used,
examine the system configurations to verify that
system functions requiring different security levels
are managed in one of the following ways:
```
- Functions with differing security needs do not
    co-exist on the same system component.
- Functions with differing security needs that exist
    on the same system component are isolated
    from each other.
- Functions with differing security needs on the
    same system component are all secured to the
    level required by the function with the highest
    security need.

```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Primary functions with lower security needs cannot
affect the security of primary functions with higher
security needs on the same system component.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
If a system component contains primary functions
that need different security levels, a third option is
to implement additional controls to ensure that the
resultant security level of the primary function(s)
with higher security needs is not reduced by the
presence of the lower security primary functions.
Additionally, the functions with a lower security
level should be isolated and/or secured to ensure
they cannot access or affect the resources of
another system function, and do not introduce
security weaknesses to other functions on the
same server.
Functions of differing security levels may be
isolated by either physical or logical controls. For
example, a database system should not also be
hosting web services unless using controls like
virtualization technologies to isolate and contain
the functions into separate sub-systems. Another
example is using virtual instances or providing
dedicated memory access by system function.
Where virtualization technologies are used, the
security levels should be identified and managed
for each virtual component. Examples of
considerations for virtualized environments
include:
```
- The function of each application, container, or
    virtual server instance.
- How virtual machines (VMs) or containers are
    stored and secured.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Unnecessary services and functions can provide
additional opportunities for malicious individuals
to gain access to a system. By removing or
disabling all unnecessary services, protocols,
daemons, and functions, organizations can focus
on securing the functions that are required and
reduce the risk that unknown or unnecessary
functions will be exploited.
Good Practice
There are many protocols that could be enabled
by default that are commonly used by malicious
individuals to compromise a network. Disabling or
removing all services, functions, and protocols
that are not used minimizes the potential attack
surface—for example, by removing or disabling
an unused FTP or web server.
Examples
Unnecessary functionality may include, but is not
limited to scripts, drivers, features, subsystems,
file systems, interfaces (USB and Bluetooth), and
unnecessary web servers.
```
```
2.2.4 Only necessary services, protocols, daemons,
and functions are enabled, and all unnecessary
functionality is removed or disabled.
```
```
2.2.4.a Examine system configuration standards to
verify necessary system services, protocols, and
daemons are identified and documented.
```
```
2.2.4.b Examine system configurations to verify the
following:
```
- All unnecessary functionality is removed or
    disabled.
- Only required functionality, as documented in
    the configuration standards, is enabled.

```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
System components cannot be compromised by
exploiting unnecessary functionality present in the
system component.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Ensuring that all insecure services, protocols, and
daemons are adequately secured with
appropriate security features makes it more
difficult for malicious individuals to exploit
common points of compromise within a network.
Good Practice
Enabling security features before new system
components are deployed will prevent insecure
configurations from being introduced into the
environment. Some vendor solutions may provide
additional security functions to assist with
securing an insecure process.
Further Information
For guidance on services, protocols, or daemons
considered to be insecure, refer to industry
standards and guidance (for example, as
published by NIST, ENISA, and OWASP).
```
```
2.2.5 If any insecure services, protocols, or
daemons are present:
```
- Business justification is documented.
- Additional security features are documented and
    implemented that reduce the risk of using
    insecure services, protocols, or daemons.

```
2.2.5.a If any insecure services, protocols, or
daemons are present, examine system
configuration standards and interview personnel to
verify they are managed and implemented in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
2.2.5.b If any insecure services, protocols, or
daemons, are present, examine configuration
settings to verify that additional security features
are implemented to reduce the risk of using
insecure services, daemons, and protocols.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective

System components cannot be compromised by
exploiting insecure services, protocols, or daemons.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Correctly configuring security parameters
provided in system components takes advantage
of the capabilities of the system component to
defeat malicious attacks.
Good Practice
System configuration standards and related
processes should specifically address security
settings and parameters that have known security
implications for each type of system in use.
For systems to be configured securely, personnel
responsible for configuration and/or administering
systems should be knowledgeable in the specific
security parameters and settings that apply to the
system. Considerations should also include
secure settings for parameters used to access
cloud portals.
Further Information
Refer to vendor documentation and industry
references noted in Requirement 2.2.1 for
information about applicable security parameters
for each type of system.
```
```
2.2.6 System security parameters are configured to
prevent misuse.
```
```
2.2.6.a Examine system configuration standards to
verify they include configuring system security
parameters to prevent misuse.

2.2.6.b Interview system administrators and/or
security managers to verify they have knowledge
of common security parameter settings for system
components.
```
```
2.2.6.c Examine system configurations to verify
that common security parameters are set
appropriately and in accordance with the system
configuration standards.

because of incorrect security parameter
configuration.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If non-console (including remote) administration
does not use encrypted communications,
administrative authorization factors (such as IDs
and passwords) can be revealed to an
eavesdropper. A malicious individual could use
this information to access the network, become
administrator, and steal data.
Good Practice
Whichever security protocol is used, it should be
configured to use only secure versions and
configurations to prevent use of an insecure
connection—for example, by using only trusted
certificates, supporting only strong encryption,
and not supporting fallback to weaker, insecure
protocols or methods.
Examples
Cleartext protocols (such as HTTP, telnet, etc.) do
not encrypt traffic or logon details, making it easy
for an eavesdropper to intercept this information.
Non-console access may be facilitated by
technologies that provide alternative access to
systems, including but not limited to, out-of-band
(OOB), lights-out management (LOM), Intelligent
Platform Management Interface (IPMI), and
keyboard, video, mouse (KVM) switches with
remote capabilities. These and other non-console
access technologies and methods must be
secured with strong cryptography.
Further Information
Refer to industry standards and best practices
such as NIST SP 800-52 and SP 800-57.
```
```
2.2.7 All non-console administrative access is
encrypted using strong cryptography.
```
```
2.2.7.a Examine system configuration standards to
verify they include encrypting all non-console
administrative access using strong cryptography.
```
```
2.2.7.b Observe an administrator log on to system
components and examine system configurations to
verify that non-console administrative access is
managed in accordance with this requirement.
```
```
2.2.7.c Examine settings for system components
and authentication services to verify that insecure
remote login services are not available for non-
console administrative access.
```
```
2.2.7.d Examine vendor documentation and
interview personnel to verify that strong
cryptography for the technology in use is
implemented according to industry best practices
and/or vendor recommendations.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Cleartext administrative authorization factors cannot
be read or intercepted from any network
transmissions.
```
```
Applicability Notes

This includes administrative access via browser-
based interfaces and application programming
interfaces (APIs).

2.3 Wireless environments are configured and managed securely.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If wireless networks are not implemented with
sufficient security configurations (including
changing default settings), wireless sniffers can
eavesdrop on the traffic, easily capture data and
passwords, and easily enter and attack the
network.
Good Practice
Wireless passwords should be constructed so
that they are resistant to offline brute force
attacks.
```
```
2.3.1 For wireless environments connected to the
CDE or transmitting account data, all wireless
vendor defaults are changed at installation or are
confirmed to be secure, including but not limited to:
```
- Default wireless encryption keys.
- Passwords on wireless access points.
- SNMP defaults.
- Any other security-related wireless vendor
    defaults.

```
2.3.1.a Examine policies and procedures and
interview responsible personnel to verify that
processes are defined for wireless vendor defaults
to either change them upon installation or to
confirm them to be secure in accordance with all
elements of this requirement.
```
```
2.3.1.b Examine vendor documentation and
observe a system administrator logging into
wireless devices to verify:
```
- SNMP defaults are not used.
- Default passwords/passphrases on wireless
    access points are not used.

```
2.3.1.c Examine vendor documentation and
wireless configuration settings to verify other
security-related wireless vendor defaults were
changed, if applicable.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Wireless networks cannot be accessed using
vendor default passwords or default configurations.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This includes, but is not limited to, default wireless
encryption keys, passwords on wireless access
points, SNMP defaults, and any other security-
related wireless vendor defaults.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Changing wireless encryption keys whenever
someone with knowledge of the key leaves the
organization or moves to a role that no longer
requires knowledge of the key, helps keep
knowledge of keys limited to only those with a
business need to know.
Also, changing wireless encryption keys
whenever a key is suspected or known to be
comprised makes a wireless network more
resistant to compromise.
Good Practice
This goal can be accomplished in multiple ways,
including periodic changes of keys, changing keys
via a defined “joiners-movers-leavers” (JML)
process, implementing additional technical
controls, and not using fixed pre-shared keys.
In addition, any keys that are known to be, or
suspected of being, compromised should be
managed in accordance with the entity’s incident
response plan at Requirement 12.10.1.
```
```
2.3.2 For wireless environments connected to the
CDE or transmitting account data, wireless
encryption keys are changed as follows:
```
- Whenever personnel with knowledge of the key
    leave the company or the role for which the
    knowledge was necessary.
- Whenever a key is suspected of or known to be
    compromised.

```
2.3.2 Interview responsible personnel and examine
key-management documentation to verify that
wireless encryption keys are changed in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.

Knowledge of wireless encryption keys cannot allow
unauthorized access to wireless networks.

### Protect Account Data

**_Requirement 3: Protect Stored Account Data_**

```
Sections
```
```
3.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting stored account data are defined and understood.
3.2 Storage of account data is kept to a minimum.
3.3 Sensitive authentication data (SAD) is not stored after authorization.
3.4 Access to displays of full PAN and ability to copy cardholder data are restricted.
3.5 Primary account number (PAN) is secured wherever it is stored.
3.6 Cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data are secured.
3.7 Where cryptography is used to protect stored account data, key management processes and procedures covering all aspects of the key
lifecycle are defined and implemented.
```
```
Overview
```
```
Protection methods such as encryption, truncation, masking, and hashing are critical components of account data protection. If an intruder
circumvents other security controls and gains access to encrypted account data, the data is unreadable without the proper cryptographic keys
and is unusable to that intruder. Other effective methods of protecting stored data should also be considered as potential risk-mitigation
opportunities. For example, methods for minimizing risk include not storing account data unless necessary, truncating cardholder data if full
PAN is not needed, and not sending unprotected PANs using end-user messaging technologies such as e-mail and instant messaging.
```
```
If account data is present in non-persistent memory (for example, RAM, volatile memory), encryption of account data is not required. However,
proper controls must be in place to ensure that memory maintains a non-persistent state. Data should be removed from volatile memory once
the business purpose (for example, the associated transaction) is complete. In the case that data storage becomes persistent, all applicable PCI
DSS Requirements will apply including encryption of stored data.
```
```
Requirement 3 applies to protection of stored account data unless specifically called out in an individual requirement.

equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.

day-to-day responsibilities, and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
3.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing
activities in Requirement 3 are documented,
assigned, and understood.
```
```
3.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that
descriptions of roles and responsibilities
performing activities in Requirement 3 are
documented and assigned.

```
3.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility for
performing activities in Requirement 3 to verify that
roles and responsibilities are assigned as
documented and are understood.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the
activities in Requirement 3 are allocated. Personnel
are accountable for successful, continuous
operation of these requirements.

3.2 Storage of account data is kept to a minimum.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
A formal data retention policy identifies what data
needs to be retained, for how long, and where
that data resides so it can be securely destroyed
or deleted as soon as it is no longer needed. The
only account data that may be stored after
authorization is the primary account number or
PAN (rendered unreadable), expiration date,
cardholder name, and service code.
The storage of SAD data prior to the completion
of the authorization process is also included in the
data retention and disposal policy so that storage
of this sensitive data is kept to minimum, and only
retained for the defined amount of time.
Good Practice
When identifying locations of stored account data,
consider all processes and personnel with access
to the data, as data could have been moved and
stored in different locations than originally
defined. Storage locations that are often
overlooked include backup and archive systems,
removable data storage devices, paper-based
media, and audio recordings.
To define appropriate retention requirements, an
entity first needs to understand its own business
needs as well as any legal or regulatory
obligations that apply to its industry or to the type
of data being retained. Implementing an
automated process to ensure data is
automatically and securely deleted upon its
defined retention limit can help ensure that
account data is not retained beyond what is
necessary for business, legal, or regulatory
purposes.
(continued on next page)
```
```
3.2.1 Account data storage is kept to a minimum
through implementation of data retention and
disposal policies, procedures, and processes that
include at least the following:
```
- Coverage for all locations of stored account
    data.
- Coverage for any sensitive authentication data
    (SAD) stored prior to completion of authorization.
    _This bullet is a best practice until its effective_
    _date; refer to Applicability Notes below for_
    _details._
- Limiting data storage amount and retention time
    to that which is required for legal or regulatory,
    and/or business requirements.
- Specific retention requirements for stored
    account data that defines length of retention
    period and includes a documented business
    justification.
- Processes for secure deletion or rendering
    account data unrecoverable when no longer
    needed per the retention policy.
- A process for verifying, at least once every three
    months, that stored account data exceeding the
    defined retention period has been securely
    deleted or rendered unrecoverable.

```
3.2.1.a Examine the data retention and disposal
policies, procedures, and processes and interview
personnel to verify processes are defined to
include all elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
3.2.1.b Examine files and system records on
system components where account data is stored
to verify that the data storage amount and retention
time does not exceed the requirements defined in
the data retention policy.
```
```
3.2.1.c Observe the mechanisms used to render
account data unrecoverable to verify data cannot
be recovered.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Account data is retained only where necessary and
for the least amount of time needed and is securely
deleted or rendered unrecoverable when no longer
needed.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Applicability Notes Methods of eliminating data when it exceeds the
retention period include secure deletion to
complete removal of the data or rendering it
unrecoverable and unable to be reconstructed.
Identifying and securely eliminating stored data
that has exceeded its specified retention period
prevents unnecessary retention of data that is no
longer needed. This process may be automated,
manual, or a combination of both.
The deletion function in most operating systems is
not “secure deletion” as it allows deleted data to
be recovered, so instead, a dedicated secure
deletion function or application must be used to
make data unrecoverable.
Remember, if you don't need it, don't store it!
Examples
An automated, programmatic procedure could be
run to locate and remove data, or a manual
review of data storage areas could be performed.
Whichever method is used, it is a good idea to
monitor the process to ensure it is completed
successfully, and that the results are recorded
and validated as being complete. Implementing
secure deletion methods ensures that the data
cannot be retrieved when it is no longer needed.
Further Information
See NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1, Guidelines for
Media Sanitization.
```
```
Where account data is stored by a TPSP (for
example, in a cloud environment), entities are
responsible for working with their service providers
to understand how the TPSP meets this
requirement for the entity. Considerations include
ensuring that all geographic instances of a data
element are securely deleted.
The bullet above (for coverage of SAD stored prior
to completion of authorization) is a best practice
until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required
as part of Requirement 3.2.1 and must be fully
considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

3.4 Access to displays of full PAN and ability to copy PAN is restricted.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The display of full PAN on computer screens,
payment card receipts, paper reports, etc. can
result in this data being obtained by unauthorized
individuals and used fraudulently. Ensuring that
the full PAN is displayed only for those with a
legitimate business need minimizes the risk of
unauthorized persons gaining access to PAN
data.
Good Practice
Applying access controls according to defined
roles is one way to limit access to viewing full
PAN to only those individuals with a defined
business need.
The masking approach should always display
only the number of digits needed to perform a
specific business function. For example, if only
the last four digits are needed to perform a
business function, PAN should be masked to only
show the last four digits. As another example, if a
function needs to view to the bank identification
number (BIN) for routing purposes, unmask only
the BIN digits for that function.
Definitions
Masking is not synonymous with truncation and
these terms cannot be used interchangeably.
Masking refers to the concealment of certain
digits during display or printing, even when the
entire PAN is stored on a system. This is different
from truncation, in which the truncated digits are
removed and cannot be retrieved within the
system. Masked PAN could be “unmasked”, but
there is no "un-truncation" without recreating the
PAN from another source.
Further Information
For more information about masking and
truncation, see PCI SSC’s FAQs on these topics.
```
```
3.4.1 PAN is masked when displayed (the BIN and
last four digits are the maximum number of digits
to be displayed), such that only personnel with a

    (includes full PAN) is documented, together
    with a legitimate business need for each role
    to have such access.

requirements in place for displays of cardholder
data—for example, legal or payment brand
requirements for point-of-sale (POS) receipts.

control.
Secondary independent control systems (for
example governing access to, and use of,
cryptography and decryption keys) prevent the
failure of a primary access control system leading
to a breach of confidentiality of stored PAN. If
hashing is used to remove stored cleartext PAN,
by correlating hashed and truncated versions of a
given PAN, a malicious individual can easily
derive the original PAN value. Controls that
prevent the correlation of this data will help
ensure that the original PAN remains unreadable.

Good Practice
A hashing function that incorporates a randomly
generated secret key provides brute force attack
resistance and secret authentication integrity.

Appropriate keyed cryptographic hashing
algorithms include but are not limited to: HMAC,
CMAC, and GMAC, with an effective
cryptographic strength of at least 128-bits ( NIST
SP 800-131Ar2).

Disk-level and partition-level encryption typically
encrypts the entire disk or partition using the
same key, with all data automatically decrypted
when the system runs or when an authorized user
requests it. For this reason, disk-level encryption
is not appropriate to protect stored PAN on
computers, laptops, servers, storage arrays, or
any other system that provides transparent
decryption upon user authentication.
Further Information
Where available, following vendors’ hardening
and industry best practice guidelines can assist in
securing PAN on these devices.

    **OR**
- If used for non-removable electronic media, PAN
    is also rendered unreadable via another

Applicability Notes^
```
```
While disk encryption may still be present on these
types of devices, it cannot be the only mechanism
used to protect PAN stored on those systems. Any
stored PAN must also be rendered unreadable per
Requirement 3.5.1—for example, through truncation
or a data-level encryption mechanism. Full disk
encryption helps to protect data in the event of
physical loss of a disk and therefore its use is
appropriate only for removable electronic media
storage devices.
Media that is part of a data center architecture (for
example, hot-swappable drives, bulk tape-backups)
is considered non-removable electronic media to
which Requirement 3.5.1 applies.
Disk or partition encryption implementations must
also meet all other PCI DSS encryption and key-
management requirements.
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Disk-level encryption typically encrypts the entire
disk or partition using the same key, with all data
automatically decrypted when the system runs or
when an authorized user requests it. Many disk-
encryption solutions intercept operating system
read/write operations and perform the appropriate
cryptographic transformations without any special
action by the user other than supplying a
password or passphrase at system start-up or at
the beginning of a session. This provides no
protection from a malicious individual that has
already managed to gain access to a valid user
account.
Good Practice
Full disk encryption helps to protect data in the
event of physical loss of a disk and therefore its
use is best limited only to removable electronic
media storage devices.
```

3.5.1.3 If disk-level or partition-level encryption is
used (rather than file-, column-, or field--level
database encryption) to render PAN unreadable, it
is managed as follows:
```
- Logical access is managed separately and
    independently of native operating system
    authentication and access control
    mechanisms.
- Decryption keys are not associated with user
    accounts.
- Authentication factors (passwords,
    passphrases, or cryptographic keys) that allow
    access to unencrypted data are stored
    securely.

```
3.5.1.3.a If disk-level or partition-level encryption is
used to render PAN unreadable, examine the
system configuration and observe the
authentication process to verify that logical access
is implemented in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.

factors (passwords, passphrases, or cryptographic
keys) and interview personnel to verify that
authentication factors that allow access to
unencrypted data are stored securely and are
independent from the native operating system’s
authentication and access control methods.

This requirement applies to keys used to encrypt
stored account data and to key-encrypting keys
used to protect data-encrypting keys.
The requirement to protect keys used to protect
stored account data from disclosure and misuse
applies to both data-encrypting keys and key-
encrypting keys. Because one key-encrypting key
may grant access to many data-encrypting keys, the
key-encrypting keys require strong protection
measures.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Maintaining current documentation of the
cryptographic architecture enables an entity to
understand the algorithms, protocols, and
cryptographic keys used to protect stored account
data, as well as the devices that generate, use,
and protect the keys. This allows an entity to keep
pace with evolving threats to its architecture and
plan for updates as the assurance level provided
by different algorithms and key strengths
changes. Maintaining such documentation also
allows an entity to detect lost or missing keys or
key-management devices and identify
unauthorized additions to its cryptographic
architecture.
The use of the same cryptographic keys in both
production and test environments introduces a
risk of exposing the key if the test environment is
not at the same security level as the production
environment.
Good Practice
Having an automated reporting mechanism can
assist with maintenance of the cryptographic
attributes.
```
```
3.6.1.1 Additional requirement for service
providers only: A documented description of the
cryptographic architecture is maintained that
includes:
```
- Details of all algorithms, protocols, and keys
    used for the protection of stored account data,
    including key strength and expiry date.
- Preventing the use of the same cryptographic
    keys in production and test environments. _This_
    _bullet is a best practice until its effective date;_
    _refer to Applicability Notes below for details._
- Description of the key usage for each key.
- Inventory of any hardware security modules
    (HSMs), key management systems (KMS), and
    other secure cryptographic devices (SCDs) used
    for key management, including type and location
    of devices, as outlined in Requirement 12.3.4.

```
3.6.1.1 Additional testing procedure for service
provider assessments only: Interview
responsible personnel and examine documentation
to verify that a document exists to describe the
cryptographic architecture that includes all
elements specified in this requirement.

assessed is a service provider.
In cloud HSM implementations, responsibility for the
cryptographic architecture according to this
Requirement will be shared between the cloud
provider and the cloud customer.
The bullet above (for including, in the cryptographic
architecture, that the use of the same cryptographic
keys in production and test is prevented) is a best
practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be
required as part of Requirement 3.6.1.1 and must

Storing cryptographic keys securely prevents
unauthorized or unnecessary access that could
result in the exposure of stored account data.
Storing keys separately means they are stored
such that if the location of one key is
compromised, the second key is not also
compromised.
Good Practice
Where data-encrypting keys are stored in an
HSM, the HSM interaction channel should be
protected to prevent interception of encryption or
decryption operations.

    least as strong as the data-encrypting key, and
    that is stored separately from the data-
    encrypting key.
- Within a secure cryptographic device (SCD),
    such as a hardware security module (HSM) or
    PTS-approved point-of-interaction device.
- As at least two full-length key components or key
    shares, in accordance with an industry-accepted

It is not required that public keys be stored in one of
these forms.
Cryptographic keys stored as part of a key
management system (KMS) that employs SCDs are
acceptable.
A cryptographic key that is split into two parts does
not meet this requirement. Secret or private keys

Definitions
A cryptoperiod is the time span during which a
cryptographic key can be used for its defined
purpose. Cryptoperiods are often defined in terms
of the period for which the key is active and/or the
amount of cipher-text that has been produced by
the key. Considerations for defining the
cryptoperiod include, but are not limited to, the
strength of the underlying algorithm, size or length
of the key, risk of key compromise, and the
sensitivity of the data being encrypted.

Keys that are no longer required, keys with
weakened integrity, and keys that are known or
suspected to be compromised, should be
archived, revoked, and/or destroyed to ensure
that the keys can no longer be used.
If such keys need to be kept (for example, to
support archived encrypted data), they should be
strongly protected.
Good Practice
Archived cryptographic keys should be used only
for decryption/verification purposes.
The encryption solution should provide for and
facilitate a process to replace keys that are due
for replacement or that are known to be, or
suspected of being, compromised. In addition,
any keys that are known to be, or suspected of
being, compromised should be managed in

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Split knowledge and dual control of keys are used
to eliminate the possibility of a single person
having access to the whole key and therefore
being able to gain unauthorized access to the
data.
Definitions
Split knowledge is a method in which two or more
people separately have key components, where
each person knows only their own key
component, and the individual key components
convey no knowledge of other components or of
the original cryptographic key.
Dual control requires two or more people to
authenticate the use of a cryptographic key or
perform a key-management function. No single
person can access or use the authentication
factor (for example, the password, PIN, or key) of
another.
Good Practice
Where key components or key shares are used,
procedures should ensure that no single
custodian ever has access to sufficient key
components or shares to reconstruct the
cryptographic key. For example, in an m-of-n
scheme (for example, Shamir), where only two of
any three components are required to reconstruct
the cryptographic key, a custodian must not have
current or prior knowledge of more than one
component. If a custodian was previously
assigned component A, which was then
reassigned, the custodian should not then be
assigned component B or C, as this would give
the custodian knowledge of two components and
the ability to recreate the key.
(continued on next page)
```
```
3.7.6 Where manual cleartext cryptographic key-
management operations are performed by
personnel, key-management policies and
procedures are implemented include managing
these operations using split knowledge and dual
control.

3.7.6.a Examine the documented key-management
policies and procedures for keys used for
protection of stored account data and verify that
they define using split knowledge and dual control.

3.7.6.b Interview personnel and/or observe
processes to verify that manual cleartext keys are
Customized Approach Objective managed with split knowledge and dual control.^
```
```
Cleartext secret or private keys cannot be known by
anyone. Operations involving cleartext keys cannot
be carried out by a single person.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This control is applicable for manual key-
management operations or where key management
is not controlled by the encryption product.
A cryptographic key that is simply split into two parts
does not meet this requirement. Secret or private
keys stored as key components or key shares must
be generated via one of the following:
```
- Using an approved random number generator
    and within a secure cryptographic device (SCD),
    such as a hardware security module (HSM) or
    PTS-approved point-of-interaction device,

**_Requirement 4: Protect Cardholder Data with Strong Cryptography During Transmission Over Open, Public_**

**_Networks_**

```
Sections
```
```
4.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting cardholder data with strong cryptography during transmission over open, public networks are
defined and documented.
4.2 PAN is protected with strong cryptography during transmission
```
```
Overview
```
```
The use of strong cryptography provides greater assurance in preserving data confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation.
```
```
To protect against compromise, PAN must be encrypted during transmission over networks that are easily accessed by malicious individuals,
including untrusted and public networks. Misconfigured wireless networks and vulnerabilities in legacy encryption and authentication protocols
continue to be targeted by malicious individuals aiming to exploit these vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to cardholder data environments
(CDE). Any transmissions of cardholder data over an entity’s internal network(s) will naturally bring that network into scope for PCI DSS since
that network stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data. Any such networks must be evaluated and assessed against applicable PCI DSS
requirements.
```
```
Requirement 4 applies to transmissions of PAN unless specifically called out in an individual requirement.
```
```
PAN transmissions can be protected by encrypting the data before it is transmitted, or by encrypting the session over which the data is
transmitted, or both. While it is not required that strong cryptography be applied at both the data level and the session level, it is recommended.
```
```
Refer to Appendix G for definitions of “strong cryptography” and other PCI DSS terms.

documented.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 4.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 4.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 4, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives. Policies and procedures, including
updates, are actively communicated to all affected
personnel, and are supported by operating
procedures describing how to perform activities.
```

procedures that are identified in Requirement 4 are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).

4.2 PAN is protected with strong cryptography during transmission.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Sensitive information must be encrypted during
transmission over public networks because it is
easy and common for a malicious individual to
intercept and/or divert data while in transit.
Good Practice
The network and data-flow diagrams defined in
Requirement 1 are useful resources for identifying
all connection points where account data is
transmitted or received over open, public
networks.
While not required, it is considered a good
practice for entities to also encrypt PAN over their
internal networks, and for entities to establish any
new network implementations with encrypted
communications.
PAN transmissions can be protected by
encrypting the data before it is transmitted, or by
encrypting the session over which the data is
transmitted, or both. While it is not required that
strong cryptography be applied at both the data
level and the session level, it is strongly
recommended. If encrypted at the data level, the
cryptographic keys used for protecting the data
can be managed in accordance with
Requirements 3.6 and 3.7. If the data is encrypted
at the session level, designated key custodians
should be assigned responsibility for managing
transmission keys and certificates.
(continued on next page)
```
```
4.2.1 Strong cryptography and security protocols
are implemented as follows to safeguard PAN
during transmission over open, public networks:
```
- Only trusted keys and certificates are accepted.
- Certificates used to safeguard PAN during
    transmission over open, public networks are
    confirmed as valid and are not expired or
    revoked. _This bullet is a best practice until its_
    _effective date; refer to applicability notes below_
    _for details._
- The protocol in use supports only secure
    versions or configurations and does not support
    fallback to, or use of insecure versions,
    algorithms, key sizes, or implementations.
- The encryption strength is appropriate for the
    encryption methodology in use.

```
4.2.1.a Examine documented policies and
procedures and interview personnel to verify
processes are defined to include all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
4.2.1.b Examine system configurations to verify
that strong cryptography and security protocols are
implemented in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
4.2.1.c Examine cardholder data transmissions to
verify that all PAN is encrypted with strong
cryptography when it is transmitted over open,
public networks.
```
```
4.2.1.d Examine system configurations to verify
that keys and/or certificates that cannot be verified
as trusted are rejected.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Cleartext PAN cannot be read or intercepted from
any transmissions over open, public networks.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Applicability Notes^ Some protocol implementations (such as SSL,
SSH v1.0, and early TLS) have known
vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to gain
access to the cleartext data. It is critical that
entities maintain awareness of industry-defined
deprecation dates for the cipher suites they are
using and are prepared to migrate to newer
versions or protocols when older ones are no
longer deemed secure.
Verifying that certificates are trusted helps ensure
the integrity of the secure connection. To be
considered trusted, a certificate should be issued
from a trusted source, such as a trusted certificate
authority (CA), and not be expired. Up-to-date
Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online
Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) can be used to
validate certificates.
Techniques to validate certificates may include
certificate and public key pinning, where the
trusted certificate or a public key is pinned either
during development or upon its first use. Entities
can also confirm with developers or review source
code to ensure that clients and servers reject
connections if the certificate is bad.
For browser-based TLS certificates, certificate
trust can often be verified by clicking on the lock
icon that appears next to the address bar.
(continued on next page)
```
```
There could be occurrences where an entity
receives cardholder data unsolicited via an insecure
communication channel that was not intended for
the purpose of receiving sensitive data. In this
situation, the entity can choose to either include the
channel in the scope of their CDE and secure it
according to PCI DSS or implement measures to
prevent the channel from being used for cardholder
data.
A self-signed certificate may also be acceptable if
the certificate is issued by an internal CA within the
organization, the certificate’s author is confirmed,
and the certificate is verified—for example, via hash
or signature—and has not expired. Note that self-
signed certificates where the Distinguished Name
(DN) field in the “issued by” and “issued to” field is
the same are not acceptable.
The bullet above (for confirming that certificates
used to safeguard PAN during transmission over
open, public networks are valid and are not expired
or revoked) is a best practice until 31 March 2025,
after which it will be required as part of Requirement
4.2.1 and must be fully considered during a PCI
DSS assessment.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Since wireless networks do not require physical
media to connect, it is important to establish
controls limiting who can connect and what
transmission protocols will be used. Malicious
users use free and widely available tools to
eavesdrop on wireless communications. Use of
strong cryptography can help limit disclosure of
sensitive information across wireless networks.
Wireless networks present unique risks to an
organization; therefore, they must be identified
and protected according to industry requirements.
Strong cryptography for authentication and
transmission of PAN is required to prevent
malicious users from gaining access to the
wireless network or utilizing wireless networks to
access other internal networks or data.
Good Practice
Wireless networks should not permit fallback or
downgrade to an insecure protocol or lower
encryption strength that does not meet the intent
of strong cryptography.
Further Information
Review the vendor’s specific documentation for
more details on the choice of protocols,
configurations, and settings related to
cryptography.

is a defined business need.
Examples
E-mail, instant messaging, SMS, and chat are
examples of the type of end-user messaging
technology that this requirement refers to.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Certain systems, at a given point in time, may not
currently be commonly targeted or affected by
malware. However, industry trends for malware
can change quickly, so it is important for
organizations to be aware of new malware that
might affect their systems—for example, by
monitoring vendor security notices and anti-
malware forums to determine whether its systems
might be coming under threat from new and
evolving malware.
Good Practice
If an entity determines that a particular system is
not susceptible to any malware, the determination
should be supported by industry evidence, vendor
resources, and best practices.
The following steps can help entities during their
periodic evaluations:
```
- Identification of all system types previously
    determined to not require malware protection.
- Review of industry vulnerability alerts and
    notices to determine if new threats exist for
    any identified system.
- A documented conclusion about whether the
    system types remain not susceptible to
    malware.
- A strategy to add malware protection for any
    system types for which malware protection has
    become necessary.
Trends in malware should be included in the
identification of new security vulnerabilities at
Requirement 6.3.1, and methods to address new
trends should be incorporated into the entity’s
configuration standards and protection

5.3 Anti-malware mechanisms and processes are active, maintained, and monitored.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
For an anti-malware solution to remain effective, it
needs to have the latest security updates,
signatures, threat analysis engines, and any other
malware protections on which the solution relies.
Having an automated update process avoids
burdening end users with responsibility for
manually installing updates and provides greater
assurance that anti-malware protection
mechanisms are updated as quickly as possible
after an update is released.
Good Practice
Anti-malware mechanisms should be updated via
a trusted source as soon as possible after an
update is available. Using a trusted common
source to distribute updates to end-user systems
helps ensure the integrity and consistency of the
solution architecture.
Updates may be automatically downloaded to a
central location—for example, to allow for
testing—prior to being deployed to individual
system components.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Periodic scans can identify malware that is
present, but currently inactive, within the
environment. Some malware, such as zero-day
malware, can enter an environment before the
scan solution is capable of detecting it.
Performing regular periodic scans or continuous
behavioral analysis of systems or processes
helps ensure that previously undetectable
malware can be identified, removed, and
investigated to determine how it gained access to
the environment.
Good Practice
Using a combination of periodic scans (scheduled
and on-demand) and active, real-time (on-access)
scanning helps ensure that malware residing in
both static and dynamic elements of the CDE is
addressed. Users should also be able to run on-
demand scans on their systems if suspicious
activity is detected – this can be useful in the
early detection of malware.
Scans should include the entire file system,
including all disks, memory, and start-up files and
boot records (at system restart) to detect all
malware upon file execution, including any
software that may be resident on a system but not
currently active. Scan scope should include all
systems and software in the CDE, including those
that are often overlooked such as email servers,
web browsers, and instant messaging software.

It is important to track the effectiveness of the
anti-malware mechanisms—for example, by
confirming that updates and scans are being
performed as expected, and that malware is
identified and addressed. Audit logs also allow an
entity to determine how malware entered the

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
It is important that defensive mechanisms are
always running so that malware is detected in real
time. Ad-hoc starting and stopping of anti-
malware solutions could allow malware to
propagate unchecked and undetected.
Good Practice
Where there is a legitimate need to temporarily
disable a system’s anti-malware protection—for
example, to support a specific maintenance
activity or investigation of a technical problem—
the reason for taking such action should be
understood and approved by an appropriate
management representative. Any disabling or
altering of anti-malware mechanisms, including on
administrators’ own devices, should be performed
by authorized personnel. It is recognized that
administrators have privileges that may allow
them to disable anti-malware on their own
computers, but there should be alerting
mechanisms in place when such software is
disabled and then follow up that occurs to ensure
correct processes were followed.
Examples
Additional security measures that may need to be
implemented for the period during which anti-
malware protection is not active include
disconnecting the unprotected system from the
Internet while the anti-malware protection is
disabled and running a full scan once it is re-
enabled.
```
```
5.3.5 Anti-malware mechanisms cannot be disabled
or altered by users, unless specifically documented,
and authorized by management on a case-by-case
basis for a limited time period.
```
```
5.3.5.a Examine anti-malware configurations, to
verify that the anti-malware mechanisms cannot be
disabled or altered by users.

```
Customized Approach Objective 5.3.5.b^ Interview responsible personnel and
observe processes to verify that any requests to
disable or alter anti-malware mechanisms are
specifically documented and authorized by
management on a case-by-case basis for a limited
time period.
```
```
Anti-malware mechanisms cannot be modified by
unauthorized personnel.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
Anti-malware solutions may be temporarily disabled
only if there is a legitimate technical need, as
authorized by management on a case-by-case
basis. If anti-malware protection needs to be
disabled for a specific purpose, it must be formally
authorized. Additional security measures may also
need to be implemented for the period during which
anti-malware protection is not active.

5.4 Anti-phishing mechanisms protect users against phishing attacks.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Technical controls can limit the number of
occasions personnel have to evaluate the veracity
of a communication and can also limit the effects
of individual responses to phishing.
Good Practice
When developing anti-phishing controls, entities
are encouraged to consider a combination of
approaches. For example, using anti-spoofing
controls such as Domain-based Message
Authentication, Reporting & Conformance
(DMARC), Sender Policy Framework (SPF), and
Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) will help stop
phishers from spoofing the entity’s domain and
impersonating personnel.
The deployment of technologies for blocking
phishing emails and malware before they reach
personnel, such as link scrubbers and server-side
anti-malware, can reduce incidents and decrease
the time required by personnel to check and
report phishing attacks. Additionally, training
personnel to recognize and report phishing emails
can allow similar emails to be identified and
permit them to be removed before being opened.
It is recommended (but not required) that anti-
phishing controls are applied across an entity’s
entire organization.
(continued on next page)
```
```
5.4.1 Processes and automated mechanisms are in
place to detect and protect personnel against
phishing attacks.

mitigate risk posed by phishing attacks.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement applies to the automated
mechanism. It is not intended that the systems and
services providing such automated mechanisms
(such as email servers) are brought into scope for
PCI DSS.
The focus of this requirement is on protecting
personnel with access to system components in-
scope for PCI DSS.
Meeting this requirement for technical and
automated controls to detect and protect personnel
against phishing is not the same as Requirement
12.6.3.1 for security awareness training. Meeting
this requirement does not also meet the requirement
for providing personnel with security awareness
training, and vice versa.
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

Definitions
Phishing is a form of social engineering and
describes the different methods used by attackers
to trick personnel into disclosing sensitive
information, such as user account names and
passwords, and account data. Attackers will
typically disguise themselves and attempt to
appear as a genuine or trusted source, directing
personnel to send an email response, click on a
web link, or enter data into a compromised
website. Mechanisms that can detect and prevent
phishing attempts are often included in anti-
malware solutions.

Sections
```
```
6.1 Processes and mechanisms for developing and maintaining secure systems and software are defined and understood.
6.2 Bespoke and custom software are developed securely.
6.3 Security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.
6.4 Public-facing web applications are protected against attacks.
6.5 Changes to all system components are managed securely.
```
```
Overview
```
```
Actors with bad intentions can use security vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to systems. Many of these vulnerabilities are fixed by vendor
provided security patches, which must be installed by the entities that manage the systems. All system components must have all appropriate
software patches to protect against the exploitation and compromise of account data by malicious individuals and malicious software.
```
```
Appropriate software patches are those patches that have been evaluated and tested sufficiently to determine that the patches do not conflict
with existing security configurations. For bespoke and custom software, numerous vulnerabilities can be avoided by applying software lifecycle
(SLC) processes and secure coding techniques.
```
```
Code repositories that store application code, system configurations, or other configuration data that can impact the security of account data or
the CDE are in scope for PCI DSS assessments.
```
```
See Relationship between PCI DSS and PCI SSC Software Standards on page 7 for information about the use of PCI SSC-validated software
and software vendors, and how use of PCI SSC’s software standards may help with meeting controls in Requirement 6.
```
```
Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.
```
```
Note : Requirement 6 applies to all system components, except for section 6.2 for developing software securely, which applies only to bespoke
and custom software used on any system component included in or connected to the CDE.

6.1 Processes and mechanisms for developing and maintaining secure systems and software are defined and understood.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 6.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 6.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 6, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives.
```
```
6.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 6 are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```
6.1.1 Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that security policies and
operational procedures identified in Requirement 6
are managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.

```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting
activities within Requirement 6 are defined and
adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting
activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and
conform to management’s intent.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, systems will not be securely
maintained, and their security level will be
reduced.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
6.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing

6.2 Bespoke and custom software are developed securely.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without the inclusion of security during the
requirements definition, design, analysis, and
testing phases of software development, security
vulnerabilities can be inadvertently or maliciously
introduced into the production environment.
Good Practice
Understanding how sensitive data is handled by
the application—including when stored,
transmitted, and in memory—can help identify
where data needs to be protected.
PCI DSS requirements must be considered when
developing software to meet those requirements
by design, rather than trying to retrofit the
software later.
Examples
Secure software lifecycle management
methodologies and frameworks include PCI
Software Security Framework, BSIMM,
OPENSAMM, and works from NIST, ISO, and
SAFECode.
```
```
6.2.1 Bespoke and custom software are developed
securely, as follows:
```
- Based on industry standards and/or best
    practices for secure development.
- In accordance with PCI DSS (for example,
    secure authentication and logging).
- Incorporating consideration of information
    security issues during each stage of the software
    development lifecycle.

```
6.2.1 Examine documented software development
procedures to verify that processes are defined
that include all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Bespoke and custom software is developed in
accordance with PCI DSS and secure development
processes throughout the software lifecycle.
```
```

This applies to all software developed for or by the
entity for the entity’s own use. This includes both
bespoke and custom software. This does not apply
to third-party software.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Having staff knowledgeable in secure coding
methods, including techniques defined in
Requirement 6.2.4, will help minimize the number
of security vulnerabilities introduced through poor
coding practices.
Good Practice
Training for developers may be provided in-house
or by third parties.
Training should include, but is not limited to,
development languages in use, secure software
design, secure coding techniques, use of
techniques/methods for finding vulnerabilities in
code, processes to prevent reintroducing
previously resolved vulnerabilities, and how to
use any automated security testing tools for
detecting vulnerabilities in software.
As industry-accepted secure coding practices
change, organizational coding practices and
developer training may need to be updated to
address new threats.
```
```
6.2.2 Software development personnel working on
bespoke and custom software are trained at least
once every 12 months as follows:
```
- On software security relevant to their job function
    and development languages.
- Including secure software design and secure
    coding techniques.
- Including, if security testing tools are used, how
    to use the tools for detecting vulnerabilities in
    software.

```
6.2.2.a Examine software development procedures
to verify that processes are defined for training of
software development personnel developing
bespoke and custom software that includes all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
6.2.2.b Examine training records and interview
personnel to verify that software development
personnel working on bespoke and custom
software received software security training that is
relevant to their job function and development
languages in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Software development personnel remain
knowledgeable about secure development
practices; software security; and attacks against the
languages, frameworks, or applications they
develop. Personnel are able to access assistance
and guidance when required.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Security vulnerabilities in bespoke and custom
software are commonly exploited by malicious
individuals to gain access to a network and
compromise account data.
Vulnerable code is far more difficult and
expensive to address after it has been deployed
or released into production environments.
Requiring a formal review and signoff by
management prior to release helps to ensure that
code is approved and has been developed in
accordance with policies and procedures.
Good Practice
The following items should be considered for
inclusion in code reviews:
```
- Searching for undocumented features (implant
    tools, backdoors).
- Confirming that software securely uses
    external components’ functions (libraries,
    frameworks, APIs, etc.). For example, if a
    third-party library providing cryptographic
    functions is used, verify that it was integrated
    securely.
- Checking for correct use of logging to prevent
    sensitive data from getting into logs.
- Analysis of insecure code structures that may
    contain potential vulnerabilities related to
    common software attacks identified in
    Requirements 6.2.5.
- Checking the application’s behavior to detect
    logical vulnerabilities.

```
6.2.3 Bespoke and custom software is reviewed
prior to being released into production or to
customers, to identify and correct potential coding
vulnerabilities, as follows:
```
- Code reviews ensure code is developed
    according to secure coding guidelines.
- Code reviews look for both existing and
    emerging software vulnerabilities.
- Appropriate corrections are implemented prior to
    release.

```
6.2.3.a Examine documented software
development procedures and interview responsible
personnel to verify that processes are defined that
require all bespoke and custom software to be
reviewed in accordance with all elements specified
in this requirement.
```
```
6.2.3.b Examine evidence of changes to bespoke
and custom software to verify that the code
changes were reviewed in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Bespoke and custom software cannot be exploited
via coding vulnerabilities.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement for code reviews applies to all
bespoke and custom software (both internal and
public-facing), as part of the system development
lifecycle.
Public-facing web applications are also subject to
additional controls, to address ongoing threats and
vulnerabilities after implementation, as defined at
PCI DSS Requirement 6.4.
Code reviews may be performed using either
manual or automated processes, or a combination
of both.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Having code reviewed by someone other than the
original author, who is both experienced in code
reviews and knowledgeable about secure coding
practices, minimizes the possibility that code
containing security or logic errors that could affect
the security of cardholder data is released into a
production environment. Requiring management
approval that the code was reviewed limits the
ability for the process to be bypassed.
Good Practice
Having a formal review methodology and review
checklists has been found to improve the quality
of the code review process.
Code review is a tiring process, and for this
reason, it is most effective when reviewers only
review small amounts of code at a time.
To maintain the effectiveness of code reviews, it
is beneficial to monitor the general workload of
reviewers and to have them review applications
they are familiar with.
Code reviews may be performed using either
manual or automated processes, or a
combination of both.
Entitles that rely solely on manual code review
should ensure that reviewers maintain their skills
through regular training as new vulnerabilities are
found, and new secure coding methods are
recommended.

    knowledgeable about code-review techniques
    and secure coding practices.
- Reviewed and approved by management prior to
    release.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Detecting or preventing common errors that result
in vulnerable code as early as possible in the
software development process lowers the
probability that such errors make it through to
production and lead to a compromise. Having
formal engineering techniques and tools
embedded in the development process will catch
these errors early. This philosophy is sometimes
called “shifting security left .”
Good Practice
For both bespoke and custom software, the entity
must ensure that code is developed focusing on
the prevention or mitigation of common software
attacks, including:
```
- Attempts to exploit common coding
    vulnerabilities (bugs).
- Attempts to exploit software design flaws.
- Attempts to exploit
    implementation/configuration flaws.
- Enumeration attacks – automated attacks that
    are actively exploited in payments and abuse
    identification, authentication, or authorization
    mechanisms. See the _PCI Perspectives blog_
    _article “Beware of Account Testing Attacks_ .”
Researching and documenting software
engineering techniques or other methods helps to
define how software developers prevent or
mitigate various software attacks by features or
countermeasures they build into software. This
might include identification/authentication
mechanisms, access control, input validation
routines, etc. Developers should be familiar with
different types of vulnerabilities and potential
attacks and use measures to avoid potential
attack vectors when developing code.
_(continued on next page)_

```
6.2.4 Software engineering techniques or other
methods are defined and in use by software
development personnel to prevent or mitigate
common software attacks and related vulnerabilities
in bespoke and custom software, including but not
limited to the following:
```
- Injection attacks, including SQL, LDAP, XPath,
    or other command, parameter, object, fault, or
    injection-type flaws.
- Attacks on data and data structures, including
    attempts to manipulate buffers, pointers, input
    data, or shared data.
- Attacks on cryptography usage, including
    attempts to exploit weak, insecure, or
    inappropriate cryptographic implementations,
    algorithms, cipher suites, or modes of operation.
- Attacks on business logic, including attempts to
    abuse or bypass application features and
    functionalities through the manipulation of APIs,
    communication protocols and channels, client-
    side functionality, or other system/application
    functions and resources. This includes cross-site
    scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery
    (CSRF).
- Attacks on access control mechanisms, including
    attempts to bypass or abuse identification,
    authentication, or authorization mechanisms, or
    attempts to exploit weaknesses in the
    implementation of such mechanisms.
- Attacks via any “high-risk” vulnerabilities
    identified in the vulnerability identification
    process, as defined in Requirement 6.3.1.

```
6.2.4 Examine documented procedures and
interview responsible software development
personnel to verify that software engineering
techniques or other methods are defined and in
use by developers of bespoke and custom
software to prevent or mitigate all common
software attacks as specified in this requirement.

6.3 Security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Classifying the risks (for example, as critical, high,
medium, or low) allows organizations to identify,
prioritize, and address the highest risk items more
quickly and reduce the likelihood that
vulnerabilities posing the greatest risk will be
exploited.
Good Practice
Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and
assigning risk ratings will vary based on an
organization’s environment and risk-assessment
strategy.
When an entity is assigning its risk rankings, it
should consider using a formal, objective,
justifiable methodology that accurately portrays
the risks of the vulnerabilities pertinent to the
organization and translates to an appropriate
entity-assigned priority for resolution.
An organization’s processes for managing
vulnerabilities should be integrated with other
management processes—for example, risk
management, change management, patch
management, incident response, application
security, as well as proper monitoring and logging
of these processes. This will help to ensure all
vulnerabilities are properly identified and
addressed. Processes should support ongoing
evaluation of vulnerabilities. For example, a
vulnerability initially identified as low risk could
become a higher risk later. Additionally,
vulnerabilities, individually considered to be low or
medium risk, could collectively pose a high or
critical risk if present on the same system, or if
exploited on a low-risk system that could result in
access to the CDE.
(continued on next page)
```
```
6.3.1 Security vulnerabilities are identified and
managed as follows:
```
- New security vulnerabilities are identified using
    industry-recognized sources for security
    vulnerability information, including alerts from
    international and national computer emergency
    response teams (CERTs).
- Vulnerabilities are assigned a risk ranking based
    on industry best practices and consideration of
    potential impact.
- Risk rankings identify, at a minimum, all
    vulnerabilities considered to be a high-risk or
    critical to the environment.
- Vulnerabilities for bespoke and custom, and
    third-party software (for example operating
    systems and databases) are covered.

```
6.3.1.a Examine policies and procedures for
identifying and managing security vulnerabilities to
verify that processes are defined in accordance
with all elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
6.3.1.b Interview responsible personnel, examine
documentation, and observe processes to verify
that security vulnerabilities are identified and
managed in accordance with all elements specified
in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
New system and software vulnerabilities that may
impact the security of account data or the CDE are
monitored, cataloged, and risk assessed.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is not achieved by, nor is it the
same as, vulnerability scans performed for
Requirements 11.3.1 and 11.3.2. This requirement
is for a process to actively monitor industry sources
for vulnerability information and for the entity to
determine the risk ranking to be associated with
each vulnerability.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Examples
Some organizations that issue alerts to advise
entities about urgent vulnerabilities requiring
immediate patches/updates are national
Computer Emergency Readiness/Response
Teams (CERTs) and vendors.
Criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include
criticality of a vulnerability identified in an alert
from Forum of Incident Response and Security
Teams (FIRST) or a CERT, consideration of the
CVSS score, the classification by the vendor,
and/or type of systems affected.
```
```
Further Information
Trustworthy sources for vulnerability information
include vendor websites, industry newsgroups,
mailing lists, etc. If software is developed in-
house, the internal development team should also
consider sources of information about new
vulnerabilities that may affect internally developed
applications. Other methods to ensure new
vulnerabilities are identified include solutions that
automatically recognize and alert upon detection
of unusual behavior. Processes should account
for widely published exploits as well as “zero-day”
attacks, which target previously unknown
vulnerabilities.
For bespoke and custom software, the
organization may obtain information about
libraries, frameworks, compilers, programming
languages, etc. from public trusted sources (for
example, special resources and resources from
component developers). The organization may
also independently analyze third-party
components and identify vulnerabilities.
(continued on next page)
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
For control over in-house developed software, the
organization may receive such information from
external sources. The organization can consider
using a “bug bounty” program where it posts
information (for example, on its website) so third
parties can contact the organization with
vulnerability information. External sources may
include independent investigators or companies
that report to the organization about identified
vulnerabilities and may include sources such as
the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) or the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Identifying and listing all the entity’s bespoke and
custom software, and any third-party software that
is incorporated into the entity’s bespoke and
custom software enables the entity to manage
vulnerabilities and patches.
Vulnerabilities in third-party components
(including libraries, APIs, etc.) embedded in an
entity’s software also renders those applications
vulnerable to attacks. Knowing which third-party
components are used in the entity’s software and
monitoring the availability of security patches to
address known vulnerabilities is critical to
ensuring the security of the software.
Good Practice
An entity’s inventory should cover all payment
software components and dependencies,
including supported execution platforms or
environments, third-party libraries, services, and
other required functionalities.
There are many different types of solutions that
can help with managing software inventories,
such as software composition analysis tools,
application discovery tools, and mobile device
management.
```
```
6.3.2 An inventory of bespoke and custom software,
and third-party software components incorporated
into bespoke and custom software is maintained to
facilitate vulnerability and patch management.
```
```
6.3.2.a Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that an inventory of bespoke
and custom software and third-party software
components incorporated into bespoke and custom
software is maintained, and that the inventory is
used to identify and address vulnerabilities.
```
```
6.3.2.b Examine software documentation, including
for bespoke and custom software that integrates
third-party software components, and compare it to
the inventory to verify that the inventory includes
the bespoke and custom software and third-party
software components.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Known vulnerabilities in third-party software
components cannot be exploited in bespoke and
custom software.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
New exploits are constantly being discovered,
and these can permit attacks against systems that
have previously been considered secure. If the
most recent security patches/updates are not
implemented on critical systems as soon as
possible, a malicious actor can use these exploits
to attack or disable a system or gain access to
sensitive data.
Good Practice
Prioritizing security patches/updates for critical
infrastructure ensures that high-priority systems
and devices are protected from vulnerabilities as
soon as possible after a patch is released.
An entity’s patching cadence should factor in any
re-evaluation of vulnerabilities and subsequent
changes in the criticality of a vulnerability per
Requirement 6.3.1. For example, a vulnerability
initially identified as low risk could become a
higher risk later. Additionally, vulnerabilities
individually considered to be low or medium risk
could collectively pose a high or critical risk if
present on the same system, or if exploited on a
low-risk system that could result in access to the
CDE.
```
```
6.3.3 All system components are protected from
known vulnerabilities by installing applicable
security patches/updates as follows:
```
- Critical or high-security patches/updates
    (identified according to the risk ranking process
    at Requirement 6.3.1) are installed within one
    month of release.
- All other applicable security patches/updates are
    installed within an appropriate time frame as
    determined by the entity (for example, within
    three months of release).

software and compare the list of installed security
patches/updates to the most recent security
patch/update information to verify vulnerabilities
are addressed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.

6.4 Public-facing web applications are protected against attacks.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Public-facing web applications are those that are
available to the public (not only for internal use).
These applications are primary targets for
attackers, and poorly coded web applications
provide an easy path for attackers to gain access
to sensitive data and systems.
Good Practice
Manual or automated vulnerability security
assessment tools or methods review and/or test
the application for vulnerabilities.
Common assessment tools include specialized
web scanners that perform automatic analysis of
web application protection.
When using automated technical solutions, it is
important to include processes that facilitate
timely responses to alerts generated by the
solutions so that any detected attacks can be
mitigated.
Examples
A web application firewall (WAF) installed in front
of public-facing web applications to check all
traffic is an example of an automated technical
solution that detects and prevents web-based
attacks (for example, the attacks included in
Requirement 6.2.4). WAFs filter and block non-
essential traffic at the application layer. A properly
configured WAF helps to prevent application-layer
attacks on applications that are improperly coded
or configured.
(continued on next page)
```
```
6.4.1 For public-facing web applications, new
threats and vulnerabilities are addressed on an
ongoing basis and these applications are protected
against known attacks as follows:
```
- Reviewing public-facing web applications via
    manual or automated application vulnerability
    security assessment tools or methods as follows:
       - At least once every 12 months and after
          significant changes.
       - By an entity that specializes in application
          security.
       - Including, at a minimum, all common
          software attacks in Requirement 6.2.4.
       - All vulnerabilities are ranked in accordance
          with requirement 6.3.1.
       - All vulnerabilities are corrected.
       - The application is re-evaluated after the
          corrections
**OR**
- Installing an automated technical solution(s) that
    continually detects and prevents web-based
    attacks as follows:
       - Installed in front of public-facing web
          applications to detect and prevent web-
          based attacks.
       - Actively running and up to date as
          applicable.
       - Generating audit logs.
       - Configured to either block web-based
          attacks or generate an alert that is
          immediately investigated.

```
6.4.1 For public-facing web applications, ensure
that either one of the required methods is in place
as follows:
```
- If manual or automated vulnerability security
    assessment tools or methods are in use,
    examine documented processes, interview
    personnel, and examine records of application
    security assessments to verify that public-facing
    web applications are reviewed in accordance
    with all elements of this requirement specific to
    the tool/method.
**OR**
- If an automated technical solution(s) is installed
that continually detects and prevents web-
based attacks, examine the system
configuration settings and audit logs, and
interview responsible personnel to verify that
the automated technical solution(s) is installed
in accordance with all elements of this
requirement specific to the solution(s).


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Customized Approach Objective^ Another example of an automated technical
solution is Runtime Application Self-Protection
(RASP) technologies. When implemented
correctly, RASP solutions can detect and block
anomalous behavior by the software during
execution. While WAFs typically monitor the
application perimeter, RASP solutions monitor
and block behavior within the application.

When using automated technical solutions, it is
important to include processes that facilitate
timely responses to alerts generated by the
solutions so that any detected attacks can be
mitigated. Such solutions may also be used to
automate mitigation, for example rate-limiting

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Scripts loaded and executed in the payment page
can have their functionality altered without the
entity’s knowledge and can also have the
functionality to load additional external scripts (for
example, advertising and tracking, tag
management systems).
Such seemingly harmless scripts can be used by
potential attackers to upload malicious scripts that
can read and exfiltrate cardholder data from the
consumer browser.
Ensuring that the functionality of all such scripts is
understood to be necessary for the operation of
the payment page minimizes the number of
scripts that could be tampered with.
Ensuring that scripts have been explicitly
authorized reduces the probability of unnecessary
scripts being added to the payment page without
appropriate management approval.
Using techniques to prevent tampering with the
script will minimize the probability of the script
being modified to carry out unauthorized
behavior, such as skimming the cardholder data
from the payment page.
Good Practice
Scripts may be authorized by manual or
automated (e.g., workflow) processes.
Where the payment page will be loaded into an
inline frame (IFRAME), restricting the location that
the payment page can be loaded from, using the
parent page’s Content Security Policy (CSP) can
help prevent unauthorized content being
substituted for the payment page.
(continued on next page)

6.4.3 All payment page scripts that are loaded and
executed in the consumer’s browser are managed
as follows:
```
- A method is implemented to confirm that each
    script is authorized.
- A method is implemented to assure the integrity
    of each script.
- An inventory of all scripts is maintained with
    written justification as to why each is necessary.

Definitions
“Necessary” for this requirement means that the
entity’s review of each script justifies and confirms
why it is needed for the functionality of the
payment page to accept a payment transaction.
Examples
The integrity of scripts can be enforced by several
different mechanisms including, but not limited to:
```
- Sub-resource integrity (SRI), which allows the
    consumer browser to validate that a script has
    not been tampered with.
- A CSP, which limits the locations the
    consumer browser can load a script from and
    transmit account data to.
- Proprietary script or tag-management
    systems, which can prevent malicious script
    execution.

6.5 Changes to all system components are managed securely.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Change management procedures must be
applied to all changes—including the addition,
removal, or modification of any system
component—in the production environment. It is
important to document the reason for a change
and the change description so that relevant
parties understand and agree the change is
needed. Likewise, documenting the impacts of the
change allows all affected parties to plan
appropriately for any processing changes.
Good Practice
Approval by authorized parties confirms that the
change is legitimate and that the change is
sanctioned by the organization. Changes should
be approved by individuals with the appropriate
authority and knowledge to understand the impact
of the change.
Thorough testing by the entity confirms that the
security of the environment is not reduced by
implementing a change and that all existing
security controls either remain in place or are
replaced with equal or stronger security controls
after the change. The specific testing to be
performed will vary according to the type of
change and system component(s) affected.
For each change, it is important to have
documented procedures that address any failures
and provide instructions on how to return to a
secure state in case the change fails or adversely
affects the security of an application or system.
These procedures will allow the application or
system to be restored to its previous secure state.
```
```
6.5.1 Changes to all system components in the
production environment are made according to
established procedures that include:
```
- Reason for, and description of, the change.
- Documentation of security impact.
- Documented change approval by authorized
    parties.
- Testing to verify that the change does not
    adversely impact system security.
- For bespoke and custom software changes, all
    updates are tested for compliance with
    Requirement 6.2.4 before being deployed into
    production.
- Procedures to address failures and return to a
    secure state.

procedures to verify procedures are defined for
changes to all system components in the
production environment to include all elements

components and trace those changes back to
related change control documentation. For each
change examined, verify the change is
implemented in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.

added or changed within the in-scope
environment, and that PCI DSS requirements
continue to be met to secure the environment.
Good Practice
Building this validation into change management
processes helps ensure that device inventories
and configuration standards are kept up to date
and security controls are applied where needed.
Examples
Applicable PCI DSS requirements that could be
impacted include, but are not limited to:
```
- Network and data-flow diagrams are updated
    to reflect changes.
- Systems are configured per configuration
    standards, with all default passwords changed
    and unnecessary services disabled.
- Systems are protected with required
    controls—for example, file integrity monitoring
    (FIM), anti-malware, patches, and audit
    logging.
- Sensitive authentication data is not stored, and
    all account data storage is documented and
    incorporated into data retention policy and
    procedures.
- New systems are included in the quarterly
    vulnerability scanning process.
- Systems are scanned for internal and external
    vulnerabilities after significant changes per
    Requirements 11.3.1.3 and 11.3.2.1.

```
6.5.2 Upon completion of a significant change, all
applicable PCI DSS requirements are confirmed to
be in place on all new or changed systems and
networks, and documentation is updated as
applicable.
```
```
6.5.2 Examine documentation for significant
changes, interview personnel, and observe the
affected systems/networks to verify that the entity
confirmed applicable PCI DSS requirements were
in place on all new or changed systems and
networks and that documentation was updated as
applicable.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
All system components are verified after a
significant change to be compliant with the
applicable PCI DSS requirements.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
These significant changes should also be captured
and reflected in the entity’s annual PCI DSS scope
confirmation activity per Requirement 12.5.2.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Due to the constantly changing state of pre-
production environments, they are often less
secure than the production environment.
Good Practice
Organizations must clearly understand which
environments are test environments or
development environments and how these
environments interact on the level of networks
and applications.
Definitions
Pre-production environments include
development, testing, user acceptance testing
(UAT), etc. Even where production infrastructure
is used to facilitate testing or development,
production environments still need to be
separated (logically or physically) from pre-
production functionality such that vulnerabilities
introduced as a result of pre-production activities
do not adversely affect production systems.
```
```
6.5.3 Pre-production environments are separated
from production environments and the separation is
enforced with access controls.
```
```
6.5.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verify
that processes are defined for separating the pre-
production environment from the production
environment via access controls that enforce the
separation.

configurations of network security controls to verify
that the pre-production environment is separate
from the production environment(s).

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The goal of separating roles and functions
between production and pre-production
environments is to reduce the number of
personnel with access to the production
environment and account data and thereby
minimize risk of unauthorized, unintentional, or
inappropriate access to data and system
components and help ensure that access is
limited to those individuals with a business need
for such access.
The intent of this control is to separate critical
activities to provide oversight and review to catch
errors and minimize the chances of fraud or theft
(since two people would need to collude in order
to hide an activity).
Separating roles and functions, also referred to as
separation or segregation of duties, is a key
internal control concept to protect an entity’s
assets.
```
```
6.5.4 Roles and functions are separated between
production and pre-production environments to
provide accountability such that only reviewed and
approved changes are deployed.
```
```
6.5.4.a Examine policies and procedures to verify
that processes are defined for separating roles and
functions to provide accountability such that only
reviewed and approved changes are deployed.

```
6.5.4.b Observe processes and interview
personnel to verify implemented controls separate
roles and functions and provide accountability such
that only reviewed and approved changes are
deployed.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Job roles and accountability that differentiate
between pre-production and production activities
are defined and managed to minimize the risk of
unauthorized, unintentional, or inappropriate
actions.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
In environments with limited personnel where
individuals perform multiple roles or functions, this
same goal can be achieved with additional
procedural controls that provide accountability. For
example, a developer may also be an administrator
that uses an administrator-level account with
elevated privileges in the development environment
and, for their developer role, they use a separate
account with user-level access to the production
environment.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Use of live PANs outside of protected CDEs
provides malicious individuals with the opportunity
to gain unauthorized access to cardholder data.
Good Practice
Entities can minimize their storage of live PANs
by only storing them in pre-production when
strictly necessary for a specific and defined
testing purpose and securely deleting that data
after use.
If an entity requires PANs specifically designed
for test purposes, these can be obtained from
acquirers.
Definitions
Live PANs refer to valid PANs (not test PANs)
that have the potential to be used to conduct
payment transactions. Additionally, when
payment cards expire, the same PAN is often
reused with a different expiry date. All PANs must
be verified as being unable to conduct payment
transactions before they are excluded from PCI
DSS scope. It is the responsibility of the entity to
confirm that PANs are not live.
```
```
6.5.5 Live PANs are not used in pre-production
environments, except where those environments
are included in the CDE and protected in
accordance with all applicable PCI DSS
requirements.

### Implement Strong Access Control Measures

**_Requirement 7: Restrict Access to System Components and Cardholder Data by Business Need to Know_**

```
Sections
```
```
7.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting access to system components and cardholder data by business need to know are defined and
understood.
7.2 Access to system components and data is appropriately defined and assigned.
7.3 Access to system components and data is managed via an access control system(s).
```
```
Overview
```
```
Unauthorized individuals may gain access to critical data or systems due to ineffective access control rules and definitions. To ensure critical
data can only be accessed by authorized personnel, systems and processes must be in place to limit access based on need to know and
according to job responsibilities.
```
```
“Access” or “access rights” are created by rules that provide users access to systems, applications, and data, while “privileges” allow a user to
perform a specific action or function in relation to that system, application, or data. For example, a user may have access rights to specific data,
but whether they can only read that data, or can also change or delete the data is determined by the user’s assigned privileges.
```
```
“Need to know” refers to providing access to only the least amount of data needed to perform a job.
```
```
“Least privileges” refers to providing only the minimum level of privileges needed to perform a job.
```
```
These requirements apply to user accounts and access for employees, contractors, consultants, and internal and external vendors and other
third parties (for example, for providing support or maintenance services). Certain requirements also apply to application and system accounts
used by the entity (also called “service accounts”).
```
```
These requirements do not apply to consumers (cardholders).
Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
7.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting access to system components and cardholder data by business need to know are defined and understood.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 7.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 7.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 7, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives.
```
```
7.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 7 are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```
7.1.1 Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that security policies and
operational procedures identified in Requirement 7
are managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting
activities within Requirement 7 are defined and
adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting
activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and
conform to management’s intent.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities, and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
7.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing
activities in Requirement 7 are documented,
assigned, and understood.
```
```
7.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that
descriptions of roles and responsibilities for
performing activities in Requirement 7 are
documented and assigned.
```
```
7.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility for
performing activities in Requirement 7 to verify that
roles and responsibilities are assigned as and are
understood.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the
activities in Requirement 7 are allocated. Personnel
are accountable for successful, continuous
operation of these requirements.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
7.2 Access to system components and data is appropriately defined and assigned.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Defining an access control model that is
appropriate for the entity’s technology and access
control philosophy supports a consistent and
uniform way of allocating access and reduces the
possibility of errors such as the granting of
excessive rights.
Good Practice
A factor to consider when defining access needs
is the separation of duties principle. This principle
is intended to prevent fraud and misuse or theft of
resources. For example, 1) dividing mission-
critical functions and information system support
functions among different individuals and/or
functions, 2) establishing roles such that
information system support activities are
performed by different functions/individuals (for
example, system management, programming,
configuration management, quality assurance and
testing, and network security), and 3) ensuring
security personnel administering access control
functions do not also administer audit functions.
In environments where one individual performs
multiple functions, such as administration and
security operations, duties may be assigned so
that no single individual has end-to-end control of
a process without an independent checkpoint. For
example, responsibility for configuration and
responsibility for approving changes could be
assigned to separate individuals.
(continued on next page)
```
```
7.2.1 An access control model is defined and
includes granting access as follows:
```
- Appropriate access depending on the entity’s
    business and access needs.
- Access to system components and data
    resources that is based on users’ job
    classification and functions.
- The least privileges required (for example, user,
    administrator) to perform a job function.

```
7.2.1.a Examine documented policies and
procedures and interview personnel to verify the
access control model is defined in accordance with
all elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
7.2.1.b Examine access control model settings and
verify that access needs are appropriately defined
in accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Access requirements are established according to
job functions following least-privilege and need-to-
know principles.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Definitions
Key elements of an access control model include:
```
- Resources to be protected (the
    systems/devices/data to which access is
    needed),
- Job functions that need access to the resource
    (for example, system administrator, call-center
    personnel, store clerk), and
- Which activities each job function needs to
    perform (for example, read/write or query).
Once job functions, resources, and activities per
job functions are defined, individuals can be
granted access accordingly.
**Examples**
Access control models that entities can consider
include role-based access control (RBAC) and
attribute-based access control (ABAC). The
access control model used by a given entity
depends on their business and access needs.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Assigning least privileges helps prevent users
without sufficient knowledge about the application
from incorrectly or accidentally changing
application configuration or altering its security
settings. Enforcing least privilege also helps to
minimize the scope of damage if an unauthorized
person gains access to a user ID.
Good Practice
Access rights are granted to a user by
assignment to one or several functions. Assess is
assigned depending on the specific user functions
and with the minimum scope required for the job.
When assigning privileged access, it is important
to assign individuals only the privileges they need
to perform their job (the “least privileges”). For
example, the database administrator or backup
administrator should not be assigned the same
privileges as the overall systems administrator.
Once needs are defined for user functions (per
PCI DSS requirement 7.2.1), it is easy to grant
individuals access according to their job
classification and function by using the already-
created roles.
Entities may wish to consider use of Privileged
Access Management (PAM), which is a method to
grant access to privileged accounts only when
those privileges are required, immediately
revoking that access once they are no longer
needed.
```
```
7.2.2 Access is assigned to users, including
privileged users, based on:
```
- Job classification and function.
- Least privileges necessary to perform job
    responsibilities.

```
7.2.2.a Examine policies and procedures to verify
they cover assigning access to users in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
7.2.2.b Examine user access settings, including for
privileged users, and interview responsible
management personnel to verify that privileges
assigned are in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
7.2.2.c Interview personnel responsible for
assigning access to verify that privileged user
access is assigned in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Access to systems and data is limited to only the
access needed to perform job functions, as defined
in the related access roles.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Documented approval (for example, in writing or
electronically) assures that those with access and
privileges are known and authorized by
management, and that their access is necessary
for their job function.
```
```
7.2.3 Required privileges are approved by
authorized personnel.
```
```
7.2.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verify

that:
```
- Documented approval exists for the assigned
    privileges.
- The approval was by authorized personnel.
- Specified privileges match the roles assigned to
    the individual.

```
Customized Approach Objective
```

Access privileges cannot be granted to users
without appropriate, documented authorization.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Regular review of access rights helps to detect
excessive access rights remaining after user job
responsibilities change, system functions change,
or other modifications. If excessive user rights are
not revoked in due time, they may be used by
malicious users for unauthorized access.
This review provides another opportunity to
ensure that accounts for all terminated users have
been removed (if any were missed at the time of
termination), as well as to ensure that any third
parties that no longer need access have had their
access terminated.
Good Practice
When a user transfers into a new role or a new
department, typically the privileges and access
associated with their former role are no longer
required. Continued access to privileges or
functions that are no longer required may
introduce the risk of misuse or errors. Therefore,
when responsibilities change, processes that
revalidate access help to ensure user access is
appropriate for the user’s new responsibilities.
Entities can consider implementing a regular,
repeatable process for conducting reviews of
access rights, and assigning “data owners” that
are responsible for managing and monitoring
access to data related to their job function and
that also ensure user access remains current and
appropriate. As an example, a direct manager
could review team access monthly, while the
senior manager reviews their groups’ access
quarterly, both making updates to access as
needed. The intent of these best practices is to
support and facilitate conducting the reviews at
least once every 6 months.
```
```
7.2.4 All user accounts and related access
privileges, including third-party/vendor accounts, are
reviewed as follows:
```
- At least once every six months.
- To ensure user accounts and access remain
    appropriate based on job function.
- Any inappropriate access is addressed.
- Management acknowledges that access remains
    appropriate.

7.2.4.b Interview responsible personnel and
examine documented results of periodic reviews of
user accounts to verify that all the results are in
accordance with all elements specified in this

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
It is important to establish the appropriate access
level for application or system accounts. If such
accounts are compromised, malicious users will
receive the same access level as that granted to
the application or system. Therefore, it is
important to ensure limited access is granted to
system and application accounts on the same
basis as to user accounts.
Good Practice
Entities may want to consider establishing a
baseline when setting up these application and
system accounts including the following as
applicable to the organization:
```
- Making sure that the account is not a member
    of a privileged group such as domain
    administrators, local administrators, or root.
- Restricting which computers the account can
    be used on.
- Restricting hours of use.
- Removing any additional settings like VPN
    access and remote access.

```
7.2.5 All application and system accounts and
related access privileges are assigned and
managed as follows:

- Access is limited to the systems, applications, or
    processes that specifically require their use.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The misuse of query access to repositories of
cardholder data has been a regular cause of data
breaches. Limiting such access to administrators
reduces the risk of such access being abused by
unauthorized users.
Definitions
“Programmatic methods” means granting access
through means such as database stored
procedures that allow users to perform controlled
actions to data in a table, rather than via direct,
unfiltered access to the data repository by end
users (except for the responsible administrator(s),
who need direct access to the database for their
administrative duties).
Good Practice
Typical user actions include moving, copying, and
deleting data. Also consider the scope of privilege
needed when granting access. For example,
access can be granted to specific objects such as
data elements, files, tables, indexes, views, and
stored routines. Granting access to repositories of
cardholder data should follow the same process
as all other granted access, meaning that it is
based on roles, with only the privileges assigned
to each user that are needed to perform their job
functions.
```
```
7.2.6 All user access to query repositories of stored
cardholder data is restricted as follows:
```
- Via applications or other programmatic methods,
    with access and allowed actions based on user
    roles and least privileges.
- Only the responsible administrator(s) can directly
    access or query repositories of stored CHD.

```
7.2.6.a Examine policies and procedures and
interview personnel to verify processes are defined
for granting user access to query repositories of
stored cardholder data, in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.

7.2.6.b Examine configuration settings for querying
repositories of stored cardholder data to verify they
are in accordance with all elements specified in
this requirement.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Direct unfiltered (ad hoc) query access to
cardholder data repositories is prohibited, unless
performed by an authorized administrator.
```
```
Applicability Notes

```
This requirement applies to controls for user access
to query repositories of stored cardholder data.

7.3 Access to system components and data is managed via an access control system(s).
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without a mechanism to restrict access based on
user’s need to know, a user may unknowingly be
granted access to cardholder data. Access control
systems automate the process of restricting
access and assigning privileges.

**_Requirement 8: Identify Users and Authenticate Access to System Components_**

```
Sections
```
```
8.1 Processes and mechanisms for identifying users and authenticating access to system components are defined and understood.
8.2 User identification and related accounts for users and administrators are strictly managed throughout an account’s lifecycle.
8.3 Strong authentication for users and administrators is established and managed.
8.4 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented to secure access into the CDE
8.5 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems are configured to prevent misuse.
8.6 Use of application and system accounts and associated authentication factors is strictly managed.
```
```
Overview
```
```
Two fundamental principles of identifying and authenticating users are to 1) establish the identity of an individual or process on a computer
system, and 2) prove or verify the user associated with the identity is who the user claims to be.
```
```
Identification of an individual or process on a computer system is conducted by associating an identity with a person or process through an
identifier, such as a user, system, or application ID. These IDs (also referred to as “accounts”) fundamentally establish the identity of an
individual or process by assigning unique identification to each person or process to distinguish one user or process from another. When each
user or process can be uniquely identified, it ensures there is accountability for actions performed by that identity. When such accountability is in
place, actions taken can be traced to known and authorized users and processes.
```
```
The element used to prove or verify the identity is known as the authentication factor. Authentication factors are 1) something you know, such
as a password or passphrase, 2) something you have, such as a token device or smart card, or 3) something you are, such as a biometric
element.
```
```
The ID and the authentication factor together are considered authentication credentials and are used to gain access to the rights and privileges
associated with a user, application, system, or service accounts.
```
```
(continued on next page)
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
These requirements for identity and authentication are based on industry-accepted security principles and best practices to support the payment
ecosystem. NIST Special Publication 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines provides additional information on acceptable frameworks for digital
identity and authentication factors. It is important to note that the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines is intended for US Federal Agencies and
should be viewed in its entirety. Many of the concepts and approaches defined in these guidelines are expected to work with each other and
not as standalone parameters.
```
```
Note : Unless otherwise stated in the requirement, these requirements apply to all accounts on all system components , unless specifically
called out in an individual requirement, including but not limited to:
```
- _Point-of-sale accounts_
- _Accounts with administrative capabilities_
- _System and application accounts_
- _All accounts used to view or access cardholder data or to access systems with cardholder data.
This includes accounts used by employees, contractors, consultants, internal and external vendors, and other third parties (for example, for
providing support or maintenance services).
Certain requirements are not intended to apply to user accounts that have access to only one card number at a time to facilitate a single
transaction (such as IDs used by cashiers on point-of-sale terminals). When items do not apply, they are noted directly within the specific
requirement._
**These requirements do not apply to accounts used by consumers (cardholders).**

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
8.1 Processes and mechanisms for identifying users and authenticating access to system components are defined and understood.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 8.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 8.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 8, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives.
```
```
8.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 8 are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```
8.1.1 Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that security policies and
operational procedures that are identified in
Requirement 8 are managed in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting
activities within Requirement 8 are defined and
adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting
activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and
conform to management’s intent.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
8.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing
activities in Requirement 8 are documented,
assigned, and understood.
```
```
8.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that
descriptions of roles and responsibilities for
performing activities in Requirement 8 are
documented and assigned.
```
```
8.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility for
performing activities in Requirement 8 to verify that
roles and responsibilities are assigned as
Customized Approach Objective documented and are understood.^
```
```
Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the
activities in Requirement 8 are allocated. Personnel
are accountable for successful, continuous
operation of these requirements.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
8.2 User identification and related accounts for users and administrators are strictly managed throughout an account’s lifecycle.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The ability to trace actions performed on a
computer system to an individual establishes
accountability and traceability and is fundamental
to establishing effective access controls.
By ensuring each user is uniquely identified,
instead of using one ID for several employees, an
organization can maintain individual responsibility
for actions and an effective record in the audit log
per employee. In addition, this will assist with
issue resolution and containment when misuse or
malicious intent occurs.
```
```
8.2.1 All users are assigned a unique ID before
access to system components or cardholder data is
allowed.
```
```
8.2.1.a Interview responsible personnel to verify
that all users are assigned a unique ID for access
to system components and cardholder data.
```
```
8.2.1.b Examine audit logs and other evidence to
verify that access to system components and
cardholder data can be uniquely identified and
associated with individuals.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
All actions by all users are attributable to an
individual.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is not intended to apply to user
accounts within point-of-sale terminals that have
access to only one card number at a time to
facilitate a single transaction (such as IDs used by
cashiers on point-of-sale terminals).
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Group, shared, or generic (or default) accounts
are typically delivered with software or operating
systems—for example, root or with privileges
associated with a specific function, such as an
administrator.
If multiple users share the same authentication
credentials (for example, user account and
password), it becomes impossible to trace system
access and activities to an individual. In turn, this
prevents an entity from assigning accountability
for, or having effective logging of, an individual’s
actions since a given action could have been
performed by anyone in the group with knowledge
of the user ID and associated authentication
factors.
The ability to associate individuals to the actions
performed with an account is essential to provide
individual accountability and traceability regarding
who performed an action, what action was
performed, and when that action occurred.
Good Practice
If shared accounts are used for any reason,
strong management controls need to be
established to maintain individual accountability
and traceability.
(continued on next page)
```
```
8.2.2 Group, shared, or generic accounts, or other
shared authentication credentials are only used
when necessary on an exception basis, and are
managed as follows:
```
- Account use is prevented unless needed for an
    exceptional circumstance.
- Use is limited to the time needed for the
    exceptional circumstance.
- Business justification for use is documented.
- Use is explicitly approved by management.
- Individual user identity is confirmed before
    access to an account is granted.
- Every action taken is attributable to an individual
    user.

```
8.2.2.a Examine user account lists on system
components and applicable documentation to
verify that shared authentication credentials are
only used when necessary, on an exception basis,
and are managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
8.2.2.b Examine authentication policies and
procedures to verify processes are defined for
shared authentication credentials such that they
are only used when necessary, on an exception
basis, and are managed in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
8.2.2.c Interview system administrators to verify
that shared authentication credentials are only
used when necessary, on an exception basis, and
are managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
All actions performed by users with generic, system,
or shared IDs are attributable to an individual
person.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is not intended to apply to user
accounts within point-of-sale terminals that have
access to only one card number at a time to
facilitate a single transaction (such as IDs used by
cashiers on point-of-sale terminals).
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Examples
Tools and techniques can facilitate both
management and security of these types of
accounts and confirm individual user identity
before access to an account is granted. Entities
can consider password vaults or other system-
managed controls such as the sudo command.
An example of an exceptional circumstance is
where all other authentication methods have
failed, and a shared account is needed for
emergency use or “break the glass” administrator
access.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Service providers with remote access to customer
premises typically use this access to support POS
POI systems or provide other remote services.
If a service provider uses the same authentication
factors to access multiple customers, all the
service provider’s customers can easily be
compromised if an attacker compromises that one
factor.
Criminals know this and deliberately target
service providers looking for a shared
authentication factor that gives them remote
access to many merchants via that single factor.
Examples
Technologies such as multi-factor mechanisms
that provide a unique credential for each
connection (such as a single-use password) could
also meet the intent of this requirement.
```
```
8.2.3 Additional requirement for service
providers only: Service providers with remote
access to customer premises use unique
authentication factors for each customer premises.
```
```
8.2.3 Additional testing procedure for service
provider assessments only: Examine
authentication policies and procedures and
interview personnel to verify that service providers
with remote access to customer premises use
unique authentication factors for remote access to
each customer premises.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
A service provider’s credential used for one
customer cannot be used for any other customer.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement applies only when the entity being
assessed is a service provider.
This requirement is not intended to apply to service
providers accessing their own shared services
environments, where multiple customer
environments are hosted.
If service provider employees use shared
authentication factors to remotely access customer
premises, these factors must be unique per
customer and managed in accordance with
Requirement 8.2.2.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
It is imperative that the lifecycle of a user ID
(additions, deletions, and modifications) is
controlled so that only authorized accounts can
perform functions, actions are auditable, and
privileges are limited to only what is required.
Attackers often compromise an existing account
and then escalate the privileges of that account to
perform unauthorized acts, or they may create
new IDs to continue their activity in the
background. It is essential to detect and respond
when user accounts are created or changed
outside the normal change process or without
corresponding authorization.
```
```
8.2.4 Addition, deletion, and modification of user
IDs, authentication factors, and other identifier
objects are managed as follows:
```
- Authorized with the appropriate approval.
- Implemented with only the privileges specified
    on the documented approval.

```
8.2.4 Examine documented authorizations across
various phases of the account lifecycle (additions,
modifications, and deletions) and examine system
settings to verify the activity has been managed in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Lifecycle events for user IDs and authentication
factors cannot occur without appropriate
authorization.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement applies to all user accounts,
including employees, contractors, consultants,
temporary workers, and third-party vendors.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If an employee or third party/vendor has left the
company and still has access to the network via
their user account, unnecessary or malicious
access to cardholder data could occur—either by
the former employee or by a malicious user who
exploits the old and/or unused account.
```
```
8.2.5 Access for terminated users is immediately
revoked.
```
```
8.2.5.a Examine information sources for terminated
users and review current user access lists—for
both local and remote access—to verify that
terminated user IDs have been deactivated or
removed from the access lists.
```
```
8.2.5.b Interview responsible personnel to verify
that all physical authentication factors—such as,
smart cards, tokens, etc.—have been returned or
deactivated for terminated users.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The accounts of terminated users cannot be used.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Accounts that are not used regularly are often
targets of attack since it is less likely that any
changes, such as a changed password, will be
noticed. As such, these accounts may be more
easily exploited and used to access cardholder
data.
Good Practice
Where it may be reasonably anticipated that an
account will not be used for an extended period of
time, such as an extended leave of absence, the
account should be disabled as soon as the leave
begins, rather than waiting 90 days.
```
```
8.2.6 Inactive user accounts are removed or
disabled within 90 days of inactivity.
```
```
8.2.6 Examine user accounts and last logon
information, and interview personnel to verify that
any inactive user accounts are removed or
disabled within 90 days of inactivity.
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Inactive user accounts cannot be used.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Allowing third parties to have 24/7 access into an
entity’s systems and networks in case they need
to provide support increases the chances of
unauthorized access. This access could result in
an unauthorized user in the third party’s
environment or a malicious individual using the
always-available external entry point into an
entity’s network. Where third parties do need
access 24/7, it should be documented, justified,
monitored, and tied to specific service reasons.
Good Practice
Enabling access only for the time periods needed
and disabling it as soon as it is no longer required
helps prevent misuse of these connections.
Additionally, consider assigning third parties a
start and stop date for their access in accordance
with their service contract.
Monitoring third-party access helps ensure that
third parties are accessing only the systems
necessary and only during approved time frames.
Any unusual activity using third-party accounts
should be followed up and resolved.
```
```
8.2.7 Accounts used by third parties to access,
support, or maintain system components via remote
access are managed as follows:
```
- Enabled only during the time period needed and
    disabled when not in use.
- Use is monitored for unexpected activity.

```
8.2.7 Interview personnel, examine documentation
for managing accounts, and examine evidence to
verify that accounts used by third parties for
remote access are managed according to all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Third party remote access cannot be used except
where specifically authorized and use is overseen
by management.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
When users walk away from an open machine
with access to system components or cardholder
data, there is a risk that the machine may be used
by others in the user’s absence, resulting in
unauthorized account access and/or misuse.
Good Practice
The re-authentication can be applied either at the
system level to protect all sessions running on
that machine or at the application level.
Entities may also want to consider staging
controls in succession to further restrict the
access of an unattended session as time passes.
For example, the screensaver may activate after
15 minutes and log off the user after an hour.
However, timeout controls must balance the risk
of access and exposure with the impact to the
user and purpose of the access.
If a user needs to run a program from an
unattended computer, the user can log in to the
computer to initiate the program, and then “lock”
the computer so that no one else can use the
user’s login while the computer is unattended.
Examples
One way to meet this requirement is to configure
an automated screensaver to launch whenever
the console is idle for 15 minutes and requiring
the logged-in user to enter their password to
unlock the screen.
```
```
8.2.8 If a user session has been idle for more than
15 minutes, the user is required to re-authenticate to
re-activate the terminal or session.
```
```
8.2.8 Examine system configuration settings to
verify that system/session idle timeout features for
user sessions have been set to 15 minutes or less.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
A user session cannot be used except by the
authorized user.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is not intended to apply to user
accounts on point-of-sale terminals that have
access to only one card number at a time to
facilitate a single transaction (such as IDs used by
cashiers on point-of-sale terminals).
This requirement is not meant to prevent legitimate
activities from being performed while the
console/PC is unattended.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
8.3 Strong authentication for users and administrators is established and managed.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
When used in addition to unique IDs, an
authentication factor helps protect user IDs from
being compromised, since the attacker needs to
have the unique ID and compromise the
associated authentication factor(s).
Good Practice
A common approach for a malicious individual to
compromise a system is to exploit weak or
nonexistent authentication factors (for example,
passwords/passphrases). Requiring strong
authentication factors helps protect against this
attack.
Further Information
See fidoalliance.org for more information about
using tokens, smart cards, or biometrics as
authentication factors.
```
```
8.3.1 All user access to system components for
users and administrators is authenticated via at
least one of the following authentication factors:
```
- Something you know, such as a password or
    passphrase.
- Something you have, such as a token device or
    smart card.
- Something you are, such as a biometric element.

```
8.3.1.a Examine documentation describing the
authentication factor(s) used to verify that user
access to system components is authenticated via
at least one authentication factor specified in this
requirement.
```
```
8.3.1.b For each type of authentication factor used
with each type of system component, observe an
authentication to verify that authentication is
functioning consistently with documented
authentication factor(s).
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
An account cannot be accessed except with a
combination of user identity and an authentication
factor.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is not intended to apply to user
accounts on point-of-sale terminals that have
access to only one card number at a time to
facilitate a single transaction (such as IDs used by
cashiers on point-of-sale terminals).
This requirement does not supersede multi-factor
authentication (MFA) requirements but applies to
those in-scope systems not otherwise subject to
MFA requirements.
A digital certificate is a valid option for “something
you have” if it is unique for a particular user.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Network devices and applications have been
known to transmit unencrypted, readable
authentication factors (such as passwords and
passphrases) across the network and/or store
these values without encryption. As a result, a
malicious individual can easily intercept this
information during transmission using a “sniffer,”
or directly access unencrypted authentication
factors in files where they are stored, and then
use this data to gain unauthorized access.
```
```
8.3.2 Strong cryptography is used to render all
authentication factors unreadable during
transmission and storage on all system
components.
```
```
8.3.2.a Examine vendor documentation and
system configuration settings to verify that
authentication factors are rendered unreadable
with strong cryptography during transmission and
storage.
```
```
8.3.2.b Examine repositories of authentication
factors to verify that they are unreadable during
storage.
```
```
8.3.2.c Examine data transmissions to verify that
authentication factors are unreadable during
Customized Approach Objective transmission.^
```
```
Cleartext authentication factors cannot be obtained,
derived, or reused from the interception of
communications or from stored data.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Malicious individuals use "social engineering”
techniques to impersonate a user of a system —
for example, calling a help desk and acting as a
legitimate user—to have an authentication factor
changed so they can use a valid user ID.
Requiring positive identification of a user reduces
the probability of this type of attack succeeding.
Good Practice
Modifications to authentication factors for which
user identity should be verified include but are not
limited to performing password resets,
provisioning new hardware or software tokens,
and generating new keys.
Examples
Methods to verify a user’s identity include a secret
question/answer, knowledge-based information,
and calling the user back at a known and
previously established phone number.
```
```
8.3.3 User identity is verified before modifying any
authentication factor.
```

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without account-lockout mechanisms in place, an
attacker can continually try to guess a password
through manual or automated tools (for example,
password cracking) until the attacker succeeds
and gains access to a user’s account.
If an account is locked out due to someone
continually trying to guess a password, controls to
delay reactivation of the locked account stop the
malicious individual from guessing the password,
as they will have to stop for a minimum of 30
minutes until the account is reactivated.
Good Practice
Before reactivating a locked account, the user’s
identity should be confirmed. For example, the
administrator or help desk personnel can validate
that the actual account owner is requesting
reactivation, or there may be password reset self-
service mechanisms that the account owner uses
to verify their identity.
```
```
8.3.4 Invalid authentication attempts are limited by:
```
- Locking out the user ID after not more than 10
    attempts.
- Setting the lockout duration to a minimum of 30
    minutes or until the user’s identity is confirmed.

```
8.3.4.a Examine system configuration settings to
verify that authentication parameters are set to
require that user accounts be locked out after not
more than 10 invalid logon attempts.
```
```
8.3.4.b Examine system configuration settings to
verify that password parameters are set to require
that once a user account is locked out, it remains
locked for a minimum of 30 minutes or until the
user’s identity is confirmed.

An authentication factor cannot be guessed in a
brute force, online attack.

8.3.5 If passwords/passphrases are used as
authentication factors to meet Requirement 8.3.1,
they are set and reset for each user as follows:

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Strong passwords/passphrases may be the first
line of defense into a network since a malicious
individual will often first try to find accounts with
weak, static, or non-existent passwords. If
passwords are short or easily guessable, it is
relatively easy for a malicious individual to find
these weak accounts and compromise a network
under the guise of a valid user ID.
Good Practice
Password/passphrase strength is dependent on
password/passphrase complexity, length, and
randomness. Passwords/passphrases should be
sufficiently complex, so they are impractical for an
attacker to guess or otherwise discover its value.
Entities can consider adding increased complexity
by requiring the use of special characters and
upper- and lower-case characters, in addition to
the minimum standards outlined by this
requirement. Additional complexity increases the
time required for offline brute force attacks of
hashed passwords/passphrases.
Another option for increasing the resistance of
passwords to guessing attacks is by comparing
proposed password/passphrases to a bad
password list and having users provide new
passwords for any passwords found on the list.
```
```
8.3.6 If passwords/passphrases are used as
authentication factors to meet Requirement 8.3.1,
they meet the following minimum level of
complexity:
```
- A minimum length of 12 characters (or IF the
    system does not support 12 characters, a
    minimum length of eight characters).
- Contain both numeric and alphabetic characters.

```
8.3.6 Examine system configuration settings to
verify that user password/passphrase complexity
parameters are set in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```

A guessed password/passphrase cannot be verified
by either an online or offline brute force attack.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If password history is not maintained, the
effectiveness of changing passwords is reduced,
as previous passwords can be reused over and
over. Requiring that passwords cannot be reused
for a period reduces the likelihood that passwords
that have been guessed or brute-forced will be re-
used in the future.
Passwords or passphrases may have previously
been changed due to suspicion of compromise or
because the password or passphrase exceeded
its effective use period, both of which are reasons
why previously used passwords should not be
reused.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Communicating authentication policies and

and abide by the policies.
Good Practice
Guidance on selecting strong passwords may
include suggestions to help personnel select
hard-to-guess passwords that do not contain
dictionary words or information about the user,
such as the user ID, names of family members,
date of birth, etc.
Guidance for protecting authentication factors
may include not writing down passwords or not
saving them in insecure files, and being alert to
malicious individuals who may try to exploit their
passwords (for example, by calling an employee
and asking for their password so the caller can
“troubleshoot a problem”).
Alternatively, entities can implement processes to
confirm passwords meet password policy, for
example, by comparing password choices to a list
of unacceptable passwords and having users
choose a new password for any that match with
one on the list. Instructing users to change
passwords if there is a chance the password is no
longer secure can prevent malicious users from
using a legitimate password to gain unauthorized
access.
```
```
8.3.8 Authentication policies and procedures are
documented and communicated to all users
including:

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Access to in-scope system components that are
not in the CDE may be provided using a single
authentication factor, such as a
password/passphrase, token device or smart
card, or biometric attribute. Where
passwords/passphrases are employed as the only
authentication factor for such access, additional
controls are required to protect the integrity of the
password/passphrase.
Good Practice
Passwords/passphrases that are valid for a long
time without a change provide malicious
individuals with more time to break the
password/phrase. Periodically changing
passwords offers less time for a malicious
individual to crack a password/passphrase and
less time to use a compromised password.
Using a password/passphrase as the only
authentication factor provides a single point of
failure if compromised. Therefore, in these
implementations, controls are needed to minimize
how long malicious activity could occur via a
compromised password/passphrase.
Dynamically analyzing an account’s security
posture is another option that allows for more
rapid detection and response to address
potentially compromised credentials. Such
analysis takes a number of data points, which
may include device integrity, location, access
times, and the resources accessed to determine
in real time whether an account can be granted
access to a requested resource. In this way,
access can be denied and accounts blocked if it is
suspected that authentication credentials have
been compromised.

8.6 Use of application and system accounts and associated authentication factors is strictly managed.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Like individual user accounts, system and
application accounts require accountability and
strict management to ensure they are used only
for the intended purpose and are not misused.
Attackers often compromise system or application
accounts to gain access to cardholder data.
Good Practice
Where possible, configure system and application
accounts to disallow interactive login to prevent
unauthorized individuals from logging in and using
the account with its associated system privileges,
and to limit the machines and devices on which
the account can be used.
Definitions
System or application accounts are those
accounts that execute processes or perform tasks
on a computer system or application and are not
typically accounts that an individual logs into.
These accounts usually have elevated privileges
that are required to perform specialized tasks or
functions.
Interactive login is the ability for a person to log
into a system or application account in the same
manner as a normal user account. Using system
and application accounts this way means there is
no accountability and traceability of actions taken
by the user.
```
```
8.6.1 If accounts used by systems or applications
can be used for interactive login, they are managed
as follows:
```
- Interactive use is prevented unless needed for
    an exceptional circumstance.
- Interactive use is limited to the time needed for
    the exceptional circumstance.
- Business justification for interactive use is
    documented.
- Interactive use is explicitly approved by
    management.
- Individual user identity is confirmed before
    access to account is granted.
- Every action taken is attributable to an individual
    user.

```
8.6.1 Examine application and system accounts
that can be used interactively and interview
administrative personnel to verify that application
and system accounts are managed in accordance
with all elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
When used interactively, all actions with accounts
designated as system or application accounts are
authorized and attributable to an individual person.
```

This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Not properly protecting passwords/passphrases
used by application and system accounts,
especially if those accounts can be used for
interactive login, increases the risk and success
of unauthorized use of those privileged accounts.
Good Practice
Changing these values due to suspected or
confirmed disclosure can be particularly difficult to
implement.
Tools can facilitate both management and
security of authentication factors for application
and system accounts. For example, consider
password vaults or other system-managed
controls.
```
```
8.6.2 Passwords/passphrases for any application
and system accounts that can be used for
interactive login are not hard coded in scripts,
configuration/property files, or bespoke and custom
source code.
```
```
8.6.2.a Interview personnel and examine system
development procedures to verify that processes
are defined for application and system accounts
that can be used for interactive login, specifying
that passwords/passphrases are not hard coded in
scripts, configuration/property files, or bespoke and
custom source code.
```
```
8.6.2.b Examine scripts, configuration/property
files, and bespoke and custom source code for
application and system accounts that can be used
for interactive login, to verify
passwords/passphrases for those accounts are not
present.

```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Passwords/passphrases used by application and
system accounts cannot be used by unauthorized
personnel.

Stored passwords/passphrases are required to be
encrypted in accordance with PCI DSS
Requirement 8.3.2.
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Systems and application accounts pose more
inherent security risk than user accounts because
they often run in an elevated security context, with
access to systems that may not be typically
granted to user accounts, such as programmatic
access to databases, etc. As a result, special
consideration must be made to protect
passwords/passphrases used for application and
system accounts.
Good Practice
Entities should consider the following risk factors
when determining how to protect application and
system passwords/passphrases against misuse:
```
- How securely the passwords/passphrases
    are stored (for example, whether they are
    stored in a password vault).
- Staff turnover.
- The number of people with access to the
    authentication factor.
- Whether the account can be used for
    interactive login.
- Whether the security posture of accounts is
    dynamically analyzed, and real-time access
    to resources is automatically determined
    accordingly (see Requirement 8.3.9).
All these elements affect the level of risk for
application and system accounts and might
impact the security of systems accessed by the
system and application accounts.
_(continued on next page)_

```
8.6.3 Passwords/passphrases for any application
and system accounts are protected against misuse
as follows:
```
- Passwords/passphrases are changed
    periodically (at the frequency defined in the
    entity’s targeted risk analysis, which is performed
    according to all elements specified in
    Requirement 12.3.1) and upon suspicion or
    confirmation of compromise.
- Passwords/passphrases are constructed with
    sufficient complexity appropriate for how
    frequently the entity changes the
    passwords/passphrases.

```
8.6.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verify
that procedures are defined to protect
passwords/passphrases for application or system
accounts against misuse in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
8.6.3.b Examine the entity’s targeted risk analysis
for the change frequency and complexity for
passwords/passphrases used for interactive login
to application and system accounts to verify the
risk analysis was performed in accordance with all
elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1 and
addresses:
```
- The frequency defined for periodic changes to
    application and system
    passwords/passphrases.
- The complexity defined for
    passwords/passphrases and appropriateness of
    the complexity relative to the frequency of
    changes.

```
Customized Approach Objective 8.6.3.c^ Interview responsible personnel and
examine system configuration settings to verify that
passwords/passphrases for any application and
system accounts that can be used for interactive
login are protected against misuse in accordance
with all elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
Passwords/passphrases used by application and
system accounts cannot be used indefinitely and
are structured to resist brute-force and guessing
attacks.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Entities should correlate their selected change
frequency for application and system
passwords/passwords with their selected
complexity for those passwords/passphrases –
i.e., the complexity should be more rigorous when
passwords/passphrases are changed infrequently
and can be less rigorous when changed more
frequently. For example, a longer change
frequency is more justifiable when
passwords/passphrases complexity is set to 36
alphanumeric characters with upper- and lower-
case letters, numbers, and special characters.
Best practices are to consider password changes
at least once a year, a password/passphrase
length of at least 15 characters, and complexity
for the passwords/passphrase of alphanumeric
characters, with upper- and lower-case letters,
and special characters.
Further Information
For information about variability and equivalency
of password strength for passwords/passphrases
of different formats, see the industry standards
(for example, the current version of NIST SP 800-
63 Digital Identity Guidelines ).

**_Requirement 9: Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data_**

```
Sections
```
```
9.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting physical access to cardholder data are defined and understood.
9.2 Physical access controls manage entry into facilities and systems containing cardholder data.
9.3 Physical access for personnel and visitors is authorized and managed.
9.4 Media with cardholder data is securely stored, accessed, distributed, and destroyed.
9.5 Point of interaction (POI) devices are protected from tampering and unauthorized substitution.
```
```
Overview
```
```
Any physical access to cardholder data or systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data provides the opportunity for individuals to
access and/or remove systems or hardcopies containing cardholder data; therefore, physical access should be appropriately restricted.
```
```
There are three different areas mentioned in Requirement 9:
```
1. Requirements that specifically refer to sensitive areas are intended to apply to those areas only.
2. Requirements that specifically refer to the cardholder data environment (CDE) are intended to apply to the entire CDE, including any
    sensitive areas residing within the CDE.
3. Requirements that specifically refer to the facility are referencing the types of controls that may be managed more broadly at the
    physical boundary of a business premise (such as a building) within which CDEs and sensitive areas reside. These controls often exist
    outside a CDE or sensitive area, for example a guard desk that identifies, badges, and logs visitors. The term “facility” is used to
    recognize that these controls may exist at different places within a facility, for instance, at building entry or at an internal entrance to a
    data center or office space.
Refer to _Appendix G_ for definitions of “media,” “personnel,” “sensitive areas” and other PCI DSS terms.

```
9.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting physical access to cardholder data are defined and understood.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 9.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 9.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 9, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives.
Policies and procedures, including updates, are
actively communicated to all affected personnel,
and are supported by operating procedures
describing how to perform activities.
```
```
9.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 9 are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```
9.1.1 Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that security policies and
operational procedures identified in Requirement 9
are managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting
activities within Requirement 9 are defined and
adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting
activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and
conform to management’s intent.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities, and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
9.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing
activities in Requirement 9 are documented,
assigned, and understood.

9.2 Physical access controls manage entry into facilities and systems containing cardholder data.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without physical access controls, unauthorized
persons could potentially gain access to the CDE
and sensitive information, or could alter system
configurations, introduce vulnerabilities into the
network, or destroy or steal equipment. Therefore,
the purpose of this requirement is that physical
access to the CDE is controlled via physical
security controls such as badge readers or other
mechanisms such as lock and key.
Good Practice
Whichever mechanism meets this requirement, it
must be sufficient for the organization to verify
that only authorized personnel are granted
access.
Examples
Facility entry controls include physical security
controls at each computer room, data center, and
other physical areas with systems in the CDE. It
can also include badge readers or other devices
that manage physical access controls, such as
lock and key with a current list of all individuals
holding the keys.
```
```
9.2.1 Appropriate facility entry controls are in place
to restrict physical access to systems in the CDE.
```
```
9.2.1 Observe entry controls and interview
responsible personnel to verify that physical
security controls are in place to restrict access to
systems in the CDE.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Maintaining details of individuals entering and
exiting the sensitive areas can help with
investigations of physical breaches by identifying
individuals that physically accessed the sensitive
areas, as well as when they entered and exited.
Good Practice
Whichever mechanism meets this requirement, it
should effectively monitor all entry and exit points
to sensitive areas.
Criminals attempting to gain physical access to
sensitive areas will often try to disable or bypass
the monitoring controls. To protect these controls
from tampering, video cameras could be
positioned so they are out of reach and/or be
monitored to detect tampering. Similarly, physical
access control mechanisms could be monitored
or have physical protections installed to prevent
them from being damaged or disabled by
malicious individuals.
```
```
9.2.1.1 Individual physical access to sensitive areas
within the CDE is monitored with either video
cameras or physical access control mechanisms (or
both) as follows:
```
- Entry and exit points to/from sensitive areas
    within the CDE are monitored.
- Monitoring devices or mechanisms are protected
    from tampering or disabling.
- Collected data is reviewed and correlated with
    other entries.
- Collected data is stored for at least three
    months, unless otherwise restricted by law.

```
9.2.1.1.a Observe locations where individual
physical access to sensitive areas within the CDE
occurs to verify that either video cameras or
physical access control mechanisms (or both) are
in place to monitor the entry and exit points.

Restricting access to network jacks (or network
ports) will prevent malicious individuals from
plugging into readily available network jacks and
gaining access to the CDE or systems connected
to the CDE.
Good Practice
Whether logical or physical controls, or a
combination of both, are used, they should
prevent an individual or device that is not explicitly
authorized from being able to connect to the
network.
Examples
Methods to meet this requirement include network
jacks located in public areas and areas accessible
to visitors could be disabled and only enabled
when network access is explicitly authorized.
Alternatively, processes could be implemented to
ensure that visitors are escorted at all times in
areas with active network jacks.
```
```
9.2.2 Physical and/or logical controls are

ensures non-authorized individuals are prevented
from gaining access to areas containing
cardholder data. In addition, it is important to limit
access to the actual badging system and badging
materials to prevent unauthorized personnel from
making their own badges and/or setting up their
own access rules.
Good Practice
It is important to visually identify the personnel
that are physically present, and whether the
individual is a visitor or an employee.
Examples
One way to identify personnel is to assign them
badges.
```
```
9.3.1 Procedures are implemented for authorizing
and managing physical access of personnel to the

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Controlling physical access to sensitive areas
helps ensure that only authorized personnel with
a legitimate business need are granted access.
Good Practice
Where possible, organizations should have
policies and procedures to ensure that before
personnel leaving the organization, all physical
access mechanisms are returned, or disabled as
soon as possible upon their departure. This will
ensure personnel cannot gain physical access to
sensitive areas once their employment has
ended.
```
```
9.3.1.1 Physical access to sensitive areas within the
CDE for personnel is controlled as follows:
```
- Access is authorized and based on individual job

- Access is revoked immediately upon termination.
- All physical access mechanisms, such as keys,
    access cards, etc., are returned or disabled upon
    termination.

```
9.3.1.1.a Observe personnel in sensitive areas

physical access to a building or room and
potential access to cardholder data.
Good Practice
When logging the date and time of visit, including
both in and out times is considered a best
practice, since it provides helpful tracking
information and provides assurance that a visitor
has left at the end of the day. It is also good to
verify that a visitor’s ID (driver’s license, etc.)
matches the name they put on the visitor log.

```
9.4.1.1 Offline media backups with cardholder data
are stored in a secure location.
```
```
9.4.1.1.a Examine documentation to verify that
procedures are defined for physically securing
offline media backups with cardholder data in a
secure location.
```
```
Purpose
If stored in a non-secured facility, backups
containing cardholder data may easily be lost,
stolen, or copied for malicious intent.
Good Practice
For secure storage of backup media, a good
practice is to store media in an off-site facility,
such as an alternate or backup site or commercial
storage facility.
```
```
9.4.1.1.b Examine logs or other documentation
and interview responsible personnel at the storage
location to verify that offline media backups are
stored in a secure location.

```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Offline backups cannot be accessed by
unauthorized personnel.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Conducting regular reviews of the storage facility
enables the organization to address identified
security issues promptly, minimizing the potential
risk. It is important for the entity to be aware of the
security of the area where media is being stored.

Media not identified as confidential may not be
adequately protected or may be lost or stolen.
Good Practice
It is important that media be identified such that
its classification status is apparent. This does not

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Media may be lost or stolen if sent via a non-
trackable method such as regular postal mail. The
use of secure couriers to deliver any media that
contains cardholder data allows organizations to
use their tracking systems to maintain inventory
and location of shipments.
```
```
9.4.3 Media with cardholder data sent outside the
facility is secured as follows:
```
- Media sent outside the facility is logged.
- Media is sent by secured courier or other
    delivery method that can be accurately tracked.
- Offsite tracking logs include details about media
    location.

```

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without a firm process for ensuring that all media
movements are approved before the media is
removed from secure areas, the media would not
be tracked or appropriately protected, and its
location would be unknown, leading to lost or
stolen media.
```
```
9.4.4 Management approves all media with
cardholder data that is moved outside the facility
(including when media is distributed to individuals).

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If steps are not taken to destroy information
contained on hard-copy media before disposal,
malicious individuals may retrieve information
from the disposed media, leading to a data
compromise. For example, malicious individuals
may use a technique known as “dumpster diving,”
where they search through trashcans and recycle
bins looking for hard-copy materials with
information they can use to launch an attack.
Securing storage containers used for materials
that are going to be destroyed prevents sensitive
information from being captured while the
materials are being collected.
Good Practice
Consider “to-be-shredded” containers with a lock
that prevents access to its contents or that
physically prevent access to the inside of the
container.
Further Information
See NIST Special Publication 800-88, Revision 1:
Guidelines for Media Sanitization.

Good Practice
The deletion function in most operating systems
allows deleted data to be recovered, so instead, a
dedicated secure deletion function or application
should be used to make data unrecoverable.

9.5 Point-of-interaction (POI) devices are protected from tampering and unauthorized substitution.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Criminals attempt to steal payment card data by
stealing and/or manipulating card-reading devices
and terminals. Criminals will try to steal devices
so they can learn how to break into them, and
they often try to replace legitimate devices with
fraudulent devices that send them payment card
data every time a card is entered.
They will also try to add “skimming” components
to the outside of devices, which are designed to
capture payment card data before it enters the
device—for example, by attaching an additional
card reader on top of the legitimate card reader
so that the payment card data is captured twice:
once by the criminal’s component and then by the
device’s legitimate component. In this way,
transactions may still be completed without
interruption while the criminal is “skimming” the
payment card data during the process.
Further Information
Additional best practices on skimming prevention
are available on the PCI SSC website.
```
```
9.5.1 POI devices that capture payment card data
via direct physical interaction with the payment card
form factor are protected from tampering and
unauthorized substitution, including the following:
```
- Maintaining a list of POI devices.
- Periodically inspecting POI devices to look for
    tampering or unauthorized substitution.
- Training personnel to be aware of suspicious
    behavior and to report tampering or
    unauthorized substitution of devices.

```
9.5.1 Examine documented policies and
procedures to verify that processes are defined
that include all elements specified in this
requirement.

These requirements apply to deployed POI devices
used in card-present transactions (that is, a
payment card form factor such as a card that is
swiped, tapped, or dipped). This requirement is not
intended to apply to manual PAN key-entry
components such as computer keyboards.
This requirement is recommended, but not required,
for manual PAN key-entry components such as

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Keeping an up-to-date list of POI devices helps
an organization track where devices are
supposed to be and quickly identify if a device is
missing or lost.
Good Practice
The method for maintaining a list of devices may
be automated (for example, a device-
management system) or manual (for example,
documented in electronic or paper records). For
on-the-road devices, the location may include the
name of the personnel to whom the device is
assigned.
Examples
Methods to maintain device locations include
identifying the address of the site or facility where
the device is located.
```
```
9.5.1.1 An up-to-date list of POI devices is
maintained, including:
```
- Make and model of the device.
- Location of device.
- Device serial number or other methods of unique

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Regular inspections of devices will help
organizations detect tampering more quickly via
external evidence—for example, the addition of a
card skimmer—or replacement of a device,
thereby minimizing the potential impact of using
fraudulent devices.
Good Practice
Methods for periodic inspection include checking
the serial number or other device characteristics
and comparing the information to the list of POI
devices to verify the device has not been
swapped with a fraudulent device.
Examples
The type of inspection will depend on the device.
For instance, photographs of devices known to be
secure can be used to compare a device’s current
appearance with its original appearance to see
whether it has changed. Another option may be to
use a secure marker pen, such as a UV light
marker, to mark device surfaces and device
openings so any tampering or replacement will be
apparent. Criminals will often replace the outer
casing of a device to hide their tampering, and
these methods may help to detect such activities.
Device vendors may also provide security
guidance and “how to” guides to help determine
whether the device has been subject to
tampering.
Signs that a device might have been tampered
with or substituted include:
```
- Unexpected attachments or cables plugged
    into the device.
- Missing or changed security labels.
- Broken or differently colored casing.
- Changes to the serial number or other
    external markings.

```
9.5.1.2 POI device surfaces are periodically
inspected to detect tampering and unauthorized
substitution.
```
```
9.5.1.2.a Examine documented procedures to
verify processes are defined for periodic
inspections of POI device surfaces to detect
tampering and unauthorized substitution.
```
```
9.5.1.2.b Interview responsible personnel and
observe inspection processes to verify:
```
- Personnel are aware of procedures for
    inspecting devices.
- All devices are periodically inspected for
    evidence of tampering and unauthorized
    substitution.

```
Customized Approach Objective

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Entities are best placed to determine the
frequency of POI device inspections based on the
environment in which the device operates.
Good Practice
The frequency of inspections will depend on
factors such as the location of a device and
whether the device is attended or unattended. For
example, devices left in public areas without
supervision by the organization’s personnel might
have more frequent inspections than devices kept
in secure areas or supervised when accessible to
the public. In addition, many POI vendors include
guidance in their user documentation about how
often POI devices should be checked, and for
what – entities should consult their vendors’
documentation and incorporate those
recommendations into their periodic inspections.
```
```
9.5.1.2.1 The frequency of periodic POI device
inspections and the type of inspections performed is
defined in the entity’s targeted risk analysis, which is
performed according to all elements specified in
Requirement 12.3.1.

```
```
9.5.1.2.1.b Examine documented results of
periodic device inspections and interview
personnel to verify that the frequency and type of
POI device inspections performed match what is
defined in the entity’s targeted risk analysis
conducted for this requirement.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Criminals will often pose as authorized
maintenance personnel to gain access to POI
devices.
Good Practice
Personnel training should include being alert to
and questioning anyone who shows up to do POI
maintenance to ensure they are authorized and
have a valid work order, including any agents,
maintenance or repair personnel, technicians,
service providers, or other third parties. All third
parties requesting access to devices should
always be verified before being provided
access—for example, by checking with
management or phoning the POI maintenance
company, such as the vendor or acquirer, for
verification. Many criminals will try to fool
personnel by dressing for the part (for example,
carrying toolboxes and dressed in work apparel),
and could also be knowledgeable about locations
of devices, so personnel should be trained to
always follow procedures.
Another trick that criminals use is to send a “new”
POI device with instructions for swapping it with a
legitimate device and “returning” the legitimate
device. The criminals may even provide return
postage to their specified address. Therefore,
personnel should always verify with their manager
or supplier that the device is legitimate and came
from a trusted source before installing it or using it
for business.
(continued on next page)
```
```
9.5.1.3 Training is provided for personnel in POI
environments to be aware of attempted tampering
or replacement of POI devices, and includes:
```
- Verifying the identity of any third-party persons
    claiming to be repair or maintenance personnel,
    before granting them access to modify or
    troubleshoot devices.
- Procedures to ensure devices are not installed,
    replaced, or returned without verification.
- Being aware of suspicious behavior around
    devices.
- Reporting suspicious behavior and indications of
    device tampering or substitution to appropriate
    personnel.

```
9.5.1.3.a Review training materials for personnel in
POI environments to verify they include all
elements specified in this requirement.
```

9.5.1.3.b Interview personnel in POI environments
to verify they have received training and know the
procedures for all elements specified in this
requirement.

Personnel are knowledgeable about the types of
attacks against POI devices, the entity’s technical
and procedural countermeasures, and can access
assistance and guidance when required.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Examples
Suspicious behavior that personnel should be
aware of includes attempts by unknown persons
to unplug or open devices.
Ensuring personnel are aware of mechanisms for
reporting suspicious behavior and who to report
such behavior to—for example, a manager or
security officer—will help reduce the likelihood
and potential impact of a device being tampered
with or substituted.

10.1 Processes and mechanisms for logging and monitoring all access to system components and cardholder data are defined and
documented.
10.2 Audit logs are implemented to support the detection of anomalies and suspicious activity, and the forensic analysis of events.
10.3 Audit logs are protected from destruction and unauthorized modifications.
10.4 Audit logs are reviewed to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.
10.5 Audit log history is retained and available for analysis.
10.6 Time-synchronization mechanisms support consistent time settings across all systems.
10.7 Failures of critical security control systems are detected, reported, and responded to promptly.
```
```
Overview
```
```
Logging mechanisms and the ability to track user activities are critical in preventing, detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data compromise.
The presence of logs on all system components and in the cardholder data environment (CDE) allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis
when something does go wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise is difficult, if not impossible, without system activity logs.
```
```
This requirement applies to user activities, including those by employees, contractors, consultants, and internal and external vendors, and other
third parties (for example, those providing support or maintenance services).
These requirements do not apply to user activity of consumers (cardholders).
Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 10.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 10.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 10, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives.
```
```
10.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 10
are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities

Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).

10.2 Audit logs are implemented to support the detection of anomalies and suspicious activity, and the forensic analysis of events.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Audit logs must exist for all system components.
Audit logs send alerts the system administrator,
provides data to other monitoring mechanisms,
such as intrusion-detection systems (IDS) and
security information and event monitoring
systems (SIEM) tools, and provide a history trail
for post-incident investigation.
Logging and analyzing security-relevant events
enable an organization to identify and trace
potentially malicious activities.
Good Practice
When an entity considers which information to
record in their logs, it is important to remember
that information stored in audit logs is sensitive
and should be protected per requirements in this
standard. Care should be taken to only store
essential information in the audit logs to minimize
risk.
```
```
10.2.1 Audit logs are enabled and active for all
system components and cardholder data.
```
```
10.2.1 Interview the system administrator and
examine system configurations to verify that audit
logs are enabled and active for all system
components.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Records of all activities affecting system
components and cardholder data are captured.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
It is critical to have a process or system that links
user access to system components accessed.
Malicious individuals could obtain knowledge of a
user account with access to systems in the CDE,
or they could create a new, unauthorized account
to access cardholder data.
Good Practice
A record of all individual access to cardholder
data can identify which accounts may have been
compromised or misused.
```
```
10.2.1.1 Audit logs capture all individual user
access to cardholder data.
```
```
10.2.1.1 Examine audit log configurations and log
data to verify that all individual user access to

data are captured.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Accounts with increased access privileges, such
as the “administrator” or “root” account, have the
potential to significantly impact the security or
operational functionality of a system. Without a
log of the activities performed, an organization is
cannot trace any issues resulting from an
administrative mistake or misuse of privilege back
to the specific action and account.
Definitions
Accounts with administrative access are those
assigned with specific privileges or abilities for
that account to manage systems, networks,
and/or applications. The functions or activities
considered to be administrative are beyond those
performed by regular users as part of routine
business functions.
```
```
10.2.1.2 Audit logs capture all actions taken by any
individual with administrative access, including any
interactive use of application or system accounts.

```
Records of all actions performed by individuals with
elevated privileges are captured.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Malicious users often attempt to alter audit logs to
hide their actions. A record of access allows an
organization to trace any inconsistencies or
potential tampering of the logs to an individual
account. Having logs identify changes, additions,
and deletions to the audit logs can help retrace
steps made by unauthorized personnel.
```

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Turning off or pausing audit logs before
performing illicit activities is common practice for
malicious users who want to avoid detection.
Initialization of audit logs could indicate that that a
user disabled the log function to hide their
actions.
```

Malicious software, such as malware, often
creates or replaces system-level objects on the
target system to control a particular function or
operation on that system. By logging when
system-level objects are created or deleted, it will
be easier to determine whether such
modifications were authorized.
```

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
By recording these details for the auditable events
at 10.2.1.1 through 10.2.1.7, a potential
compromise can be quickly identified, with
sufficient detail to facilitate following up on
suspicious activities.
```
```
10.2.2 Audit logs record the following details for
each auditable event:
```
- User identification.
- Type of event.
- Date and time.
- Success and failure indication.
- Origination of event.
- Identity or name of affected data, system
    component, resource, or service (for example,
    name and protocol).

```
10.2.2 Interview personnel and examine audit log
configurations and log data to verify that all
elements specified in this requirement are included
in log entries for each auditable event (from
10.2.1.1 through 10.2.1.7).
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Sufficient data to be able to identify successful and
failed attempts and who, what, when, where, and
how for each event listed in requirement 10.2.1 are
captured.
```
```
10.3 Audit logs are protected from destruction and unauthorized modifications.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Audit log files contain sensitive information, and
read access to the log files must be limited only to
those with a valid business need. This access
includes audit log files on the originating systems
as well as anywhere else they are stored.
Good Practice
Adequate protection of the audit logs includes
strong access control that limits access to logs
based on “need to know” only and the use of
physical or network segregation to make the logs
harder to find and modify.
```
```
10.3.1 Read access to audit logs files is limited to
those with a job-related need.
```
```
10.3.1 Interview system administrators and
examine system configurations and privileges to
verify that only individuals with a job-related need
have read access to audit log files.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Stored activity records cannot be accessed by
unauthorized personnel.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Often a malicious individual who has entered the
network will try to edit the audit logs to hide their
activity. Without adequate protection of audit logs,
their completeness, accuracy, and integrity
cannot be guaranteed, and the audit logs can be
rendered useless as an investigation tool after a
compromise. Therefore, audit logs should be
protected on the originating systems as well as
anywhere else they are stored.
Good Practice
Entities should attempt to prevent logs from being
exposed in public-accessible locations.
```
```
10.3.2 Audit log files are protected to prevent
modifications by individuals.
```
```
10.3.2 Examine system configurations and
privileges and interview system administrators to
verify that current audit log files are protected from
modifications by individuals via access control
mechanisms, physical segregation, and/or network
Customized Approach Objective segregation.^
```
```
Stored activity records cannot be modified by
personnel.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Promptly backing up the logs to a centralized log
server or media that is difficult to alter keeps the
logs protected, even if the system generating the
logs becomes compromised.
Writing logs from external-facing technologies
such as wireless, network security controls, DNS,
and mail servers, reduces the risk of those logs
being lost or altered.
Good Practice
Each entity determines the best way to back up
log files, whether via one or more centralized log
servers or other secure media. Logs may be
written directly, offloaded, or copied from external
systems to the secure internal system or media.
```
```
10.3.3 Audit log files, including those for external-
facing technologies, are promptly backed up to a
secure, central, internal log server(s) or other media
that is difficult to modify.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
File integrity monitoring or change-detection
systems check for changes to critical files and
notify when such changes are identified. For file
integrity monitoring purposes, an entity usually
monitors files that do not regularly change, but
when changed, indicate a possible compromise.
Good Practice
Software used to monitor changes to audit logs
should be configured to provide alerts when
existing log data or files are changed or deleted.
However, new log data being added to an audit
log should not generate an alert.
```
```
10.3.4 File integrity monitoring or change-detection
mechanisms is used on audit logs to ensure that
existing log data cannot be changed without

10.4 Audit logs are reviewed to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Many breaches occur months before being
detected. Regular log reviews mean incidents can
be quickly identified and proactively addressed.
Good Practice
Checking logs daily (7 days a week, 365 days a
year, including holidays) minimizes the amount of
time and exposure of a potential breach. Log
harvesting, parsing, and alerting tools, centralized
log management systems, event log analyzers,
and security information and event management
(SIEM) solutions are examples of automated tools
that can be used to meet this requirement.
Daily review of security events—for example,
notifications or alerts that identify suspicious or
anomalous activities—as well as logs from critical
system components, and logs from systems that
perform security functions, such as firewalls,
IDS/IPS, file integrity monitoring (FIM) systems,
etc., is necessary to identify potential issues.
The determination of “security event” will vary for
each organization and may include consideration
for the type of technology, location, and function
of the device. Organizations may also wish to
maintain a baseline of “normal” traffic to help
identify anomalous behavior.
An entity that uses third-party service providers to
perform log review services is responsible to
provide context about the entity’s environment to
the service providers, so it understands the
entity’s environment, has a baseline of “normal”
traffic for the entity, and can detect potential
security issues and provide accurate exceptions
and anomaly notifications.
```
```
10.4.1 The following audit logs are reviewed at least
once daily:
```
- All security events.
- Logs of all system components that store,
    process, or transmit CHD and/or SAD.
- Logs of all critical system components.
- Logs of all servers and system components that
    perform security functions (for example, network
    security controls, intrusion-detection
    systems/intrusion-prevention systems (IDS/IPS),

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Manual log reviews are difficult to perform, even
for one or two systems, due to the amount of log
data that is generated. However, using log
harvesting, parsing, and alerting tools, centralized
log management systems, event log analyzers,
and security information and event management
(SIEM) solutions can help facilitate the process by
identifying log events that need to be reviewed.

10.5 Audit log history is retained and available for analysis.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Good Practice^
Retaining historical audit logs for at least 12
months is necessary because compromises often
go unnoticed for significant lengths of time.
Having centrally stored log history allows
investigators to better determine the length of
time a potential breach was occurring, and the
possible system(s) impacted. By having three
months of logs immediately available, an entity
can quickly identify and minimize impact of a data
breach.
Examples
Methods that allow logs to be immediately
available include storing logs online, archiving
logs, or restoring logs quickly from backups.
```
```
10.5.1 Retain audit log history for at least 12
months, with at least the most recent three months

10.6 Time-synchronization mechanisms support consistent time settings across all systems.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Time synchronization technology is used to
synchronize clocks on multiple systems. When
clocks are not properly synchronized, it can be
difficult, if not impossible, to compare log files
from different systems and establish an exact
sequence of events, which is crucial for forensic
analysis following a breach.
For post-incident forensics teams, the accuracy
and consistency of time across all systems and
the time of each activity are critical in determining
how the systems were compromised.
Examples
Network Time Protocol (NTP) is one example of
time-synchronization technology.
```
```
10.6.1 System clocks and time are synchronized
using time-synchronization technology.
```
```
10.6.1 Examine system configuration settings to
verify that time-synchronization technology is
implemented and kept current.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Common time is established across all systems.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
Keeping time-synchronization technology current
includes managing vulnerabilities and patching the
technology according to PCI DSS Requirements
6.3.1 and 6.3.3.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Using reputable time servers is a critical
component of the time synchronization process.
Accepting time updates from specific, industry-
accepted external sources helps prevent a
malicious individual from changing time settings
on systems.
Good Practice
Another option to prevent unauthorized use of
internal time servers is to encrypt updates with a
symmetric key and create access control lists that
specify the IP addresses of client machines that
will be provided with the time updates.
```
```
10.6.2 Systems are configured to the correct and
consistent time as follows:
```
- One or more designated time servers are in use.
- Only the designated central time server(s)
    receives time from external sources.
- Time received from external sources is based on
    International Atomic Time or Coordinated
    Universal Time (UTC).
- The designated time server(s) accept time
    updates only from specific industry-accepted
    external sources.
- Where there is more than one designated time
    server, the time servers peer with one another to
    keep accurate time.
- Internal systems receive time information only
    from designated central time server(s).

```
10.6.2 Examine system configuration settings for
acquiring, distributing, and storing the correct time
to verify the settings are configured in accordance
with all elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The time on all systems is accurate and consistent.
```
```

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without formal processes to detect and alert
when critical security controls fail, failures may go
undetected for extended periods and provide
attackers ample time to compromise system
components and steal account data from the

Good Practice
The specific types of failures may vary, depending
on the function of the device system component
and technology in use. Typical failures include a
system ceasing to perform its security function or
not functioning in its intended manner, such as a
firewall erasing all its rules or going offline.

- IDS/IPS.
- FIM.
- Anti-malware solutions.
- Physical access controls.
- Logical access controls.
- Audit logging mechanisms.
- Segmentation controls (if used).

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without formal processes to detect and alert
when critical security controls fail, failures may go
undetected for extended periods and provide
attackers ample time to compromise system
components and steal account data from the
CDE.
Good Practice
The specific types of failures may vary, depending
on the function of the device system component
and technology in use. However, typical failures
include a system no longer performing its security
function or not functioning in its intended
manner—for example, a firewall erasing its rules
or going offline.
```
```
10.7.2 Failures of critical security control systems
are detected, alerted, and addressed promptly,
including but not limited to failure of the following
critical security control systems:
```
- Network security controls.
- IDS/IPS.
- Change-detection mechanisms.
- Anti-malware solutions.
- Physical access controls.
- Logical access controls.
- Audit logging mechanisms.
- Segmentation controls (if used).
- Audit log review mechanisms.
- Automated security testing tools (if used).

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If alerts from failures of critical security control
systems are not responded to quickly and
effectively, attackers may use this time to insert
malicious software, gain control of a system, or
steal data from the entity’s environment.
Good Practice
Documented evidence (for example, records
within a problem management system) should
provide support that processes and procedures
are in place to respond to security failures. In
addition, personnel should be aware of their
responsibilities in the event of a failure. Actions
and responses to the failure should be captured in
the documented evidence.

10.7.3 Failures of any critical security controls
systems are responded to promptly, including but
not limited to:
```
- Restoring security functions.
- Identifying and documenting the duration (date
    and time from start to end) of the security failure.
- Identifying and documenting the cause(s) of
    failure and documenting required remediation.
- Identifying and addressing any security issues
    that arose during the failure.
- Determining whether further actions are required
    as a result of the security failure.
- Implementing controls to prevent the cause of
    failure from reoccurring.
- Resuming monitoring of security controls.

```
10.7.3.a Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that processes are defined and
implemented to respond to a failure of any critical
security control system and include at least all
elements specified in this requirement.

10.7.3.b Examine records to verify that failures of
critical security control systems are documented to
include:
```
- Identification of cause(s) of the failure.
- Duration (date and time start and end) of the
    security failure.
- Details of the remediation required to address
    the root cause.

```
Customized Approach Objective

```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
11.1 Processes and mechanisms for regularly testing security of systems and networks are defined and understood.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Requirement 11.1.1 is about effectively managing
and maintaining the various policies and
procedures specified throughout Requirement 11.
While it is important to define the specific policies
or procedures called out in Requirement 11, it is
equally important to ensure they are properly
documented, maintained, and disseminated.
Good Practice
It is important to update policies and procedures
as needed to address changes in processes,
technologies, and business objectives. For this
reason, consider updating these documents as
soon as possible after a change occurs and not
only on a periodic cycle.
Definitions
Security policies define the entity’s security
objectives and principles. Operational procedures
describe how to perform activities, and define the
controls, methods, and processes that are
followed to achieve the desired result in a
consistent manner and in accordance with policy
objectives.
```
```
11.1.1 All security policies and operational
procedures that are identified in Requirement 11
are:
```
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

```
11.1.1 Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that security policies and
operational procedures are managed in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting
activities within Requirement 11 are defined and
adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting
activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and
conform to management’s intent.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If roles and responsibilities are not formally
assigned, personnel may not be aware of their
day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities
may not occur.
Good Practice
Roles and responsibilities may be documented
within policies and procedures or maintained
within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and
responsibilities, entities can consider having
personnel acknowledge their acceptance and
understanding of their assigned roles and
responsibilities.
Examples
A method to document roles and responsibilities
is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes
who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and
informed (also called a RACI matrix).
```
```
11.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing
activities in Requirement 11 are documented,
assigned, and understood.
```
```
11.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that
descriptions of roles and responsibilities for
performing activities in Requirement 11 are
documented and assigned.
```
```
11.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility for
performing activities in Requirement 11 to verify
that roles and responsibilities are assigned as
documented and are understood.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the
activities in Requirement 11 are allocated.
Personnel are accountable for successful,
continuous operation of these requirements.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
11.2 Wireless access points are identified and monitored, and unauthorized wireless access points are addressed.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Implementation and/or exploitation of wireless
technology within a network are common paths
for malicious users to gain unauthorized access to
the network and cardholder data. Unauthorized
wireless devices could be hidden within or
attached to a computer or other system
component. These devices could also be
attached directly to a network port, to a network
device such as a switch or router, or inserted as a
wireless interface card inside a system
component.
If a wireless device or network is installed without
a company’s knowledge, it can allow an attacker
to enter the network easily and “invisibly.”
Detecting and removing such unauthorized
access points reduces the duration and likelihood
of such devices being leveraged for an attack.
Good Practice
The size and complexity of an environment will
dictate the appropriate tools and processes to be
used to provide sufficient assurance that a rogue
wireless access point has not been installed in the
environment.
(continued on next page)
```
```
11.2.1 Authorized and unauthorized wireless access
points are managed as follows:
```
- The presence of wireless (Wi-Fi) access points is
    tested for,
- All authorized and unauthorized wireless access
    points are detected and identified,
- Testing, detection, and identification occurs at
    least once every three months.
- If automated monitoring is used, personnel are
    notified via generated alerts.

```
11.2.1.a Examine policies and procedures to verify
processes are defined for managing both
authorized and unauthorized wireless access
points with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
11.2.1.b Examine the methodology(ies) in use and
the resulting documentation, and interview
personnel to verify processes are defined to detect
and identify both authorized and unauthorized
wireless access points in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
11.2.1.c Examine wireless assessment results and
interview personnel to verify that wireless
assessments were conducted in accordance with
all elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
11.2.1.d If automated monitoring is used, examine
configuration settings to verify the configuration will
Customized Approach Objective generate alerts to notify personnel.^
```
```
Unauthorized wireless access points are identified
and addressed periodically.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
The requirement applies even when a policy exists
that prohibits the use of wireless technology since
attackers do not read and follow company policy.
Methods used to meet this requirement must be
sufficient to detect and identify both authorized and
unauthorized devices, including unauthorized
devices attached to devices that themselves are
authorized.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
For example, performing a detailed physical
inspection of a single stand-alone retail kiosk in a
shopping mall, where all communication
components are contained within tamper-resistant
and tamper-evident casings, may be sufficient to
provide assurance that a rogue wireless access
point has not been attached or installed.
However, in an environment with multiple nodes
(such as in a large retail store, call center, server
room or data center), detailed physical inspection
can be difficult. In this case, multiple methods
may be combined, such as performing physical
system inspections in conjunction with the results
of a wireless analyzer.
Definitions
This is also referred to as rogue access point
detection.
Examples
Methods that may be used include but are not
limited to wireless network scans, physical/logical
inspections of system components and
infrastructure, network access control (NAC), or
wireless IDS/IPS. NAC and wireless IDS/IPS are
examples of automated monitoring tools.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
An inventory of authorized wireless access points
can help administrators quickly respond when
unauthorized wireless access points are detected.
This helps to proactively minimize the exposure of
CDE to malicious individuals.
Good Practice
If using a wireless scanner, it is equally important
to have a defined list of known access points
which, while not attached to the company’s
network, will usually be detected during a scan.
These non-company devices are often found in
multi-tenant buildings or businesses located near
one another. However, it is important to verify that
these devices are not connected to the entity’s
network port or through another network-
connected device and given an SSID resembling
a nearby business. Scan results should note such
devices and how it was determined that these
devices could be “ignored.” In addition, detection
of any unauthorized wireless access points that
are determined to be a threat to the CDE should
be managed following the entity’s incident
response plan per Requirement 12.10.1.
```
```
11.2.2 An inventory of authorized wireless access
points is maintained, including a documented
business justification.
```
```
11.2.2 Examine documentation to verify that an
inventory of authorized wireless access points is
maintained, and a business justification is
documented for all authorized wireless access
points.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Unauthorized wireless access points are not
mistaken for authorized wireless access points.
```

11.3 External and internal vulnerabilities are regularly identified, prioritized, and addressed.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Identifying and addressing vulnerabilities promptly
reduces the likelihood of a vulnerability being
exploited and the potential compromise of a
system component or cardholder data.
Vulnerability scans conducted at least every three
months provide this detection and identification.
Good Practice
Vulnerabilities posing the greatest risk to the
environment (for example, ranked high or critical
per Requirement 6.3.1) should be resolved with
the highest priority.
Multiple scan reports can be combined for the
quarterly scan process to show that all systems
were scanned and all applicable vulnerabilities
were resolved as part of the three-month
vulnerability scan cycle. However, additional,
documentation may be required to verify non-
remediated vulnerabilities are in the process of
being resolved.
While scans are required at least once every
three months, more frequent scans are
recommended depending on the network
complexity, frequency of change, and types of
devices, software, and operating systems used.
Definitions
A vulnerability scan is a combination of
automated tools, techniques, and/or methods run
against external and internal devices and servers,
designed to expose potential vulnerabilities in
applications, operating systems, and network
devices that could be found and exploited by
malicious individuals.
```
```
11.3.1 Internal vulnerability scans are performed as
follows:
```
- At least once every three months.
- High-risk and critical vulnerabilities (per the
    entity’s vulnerability risk rankings defined at
    Requirement 6.3.1) are resolved.
- Rescans are performed that confirm all high-
risk and critical vulnerabilities (as noted above)
have been resolved.
- Scan tool is kept up to date with latest
    vulnerability information.
- Scans are performed by qualified personnel and
    organizational independence of the tester exists.

```
11.3.1.a Examine internal scan report results from
the last 12 months to verify that internal scans
occurred at least once every three months in the
most recent 12-month period.
```
```
11.3.1.b Examine internal scan report results from
each scan and rescan run in the last 12 months to
verify that all high-risk and critical vulnerabilities
(identified in PCI DSS Requirement 6.3.1) are
resolved.
```
```
11.3.1.c Examine scan tool configurations and
interview personnel to verify that the scan tool is
kept up to date with the latest vulnerability
information.
```
```
11.3.1.d Interview responsible personnel to verify
that the scan was performed by a qualified internal
resource(s) or qualified external third party and that
organizational independence of the tester exists.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The security posture of all system components is
verified periodically using automated tools designed
to detect vulnerabilities operating inside the
network. Detected vulnerabilities are assessed and
rectified based on a formal risk assessment
framework. (continued on next page)
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Applicability Notes^
```
```
It is not required to use a QSA or ASV to conduct
internal vulnerability scans.
Internal vulnerability scans can be performed by
qualified, internal staff that are reasonably
independent of the system component(s) being
scanned (for example, a network administrator
should not be responsible for scanning the network),
or an entity may choose to have internal
vulnerability scans performed by a firm specializing
in vulnerability scanning.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
All vulnerabilities, regardless of criticality, provide
a potential avenue of attack and must therefore
be addressed periodically, with the vulnerabilities
that expose the most risk addressed more quickly
to limit the potential window of attack.
```
```
11.3.1.1 All other applicable vulnerabilities (those
not ranked as high-risk or critical per the entity’s
vulnerability risk rankings defined at Requirement
6.3.1) are managed as follows:
```
- Addressed based on the risk defined in the
    entity’s targeted risk analysis, which is
    performed according to all elements specified
    in Requirement 12.3.1.
- Rescans are conducted as needed.

```
11.3.1.1.a Examine the entity’s targeted risk
analysis that defines the risk for addressing all
other applicable vulnerabilities (those not ranked
as high-risk or critical per the entity’s vulnerability
risk rankings at Requirement 6.3.1) to verify the
risk analysis was performed in accordance with all
elements specified at Requirement 12.3.1.
```
```
11.3.1.1.b Interview responsible personnel and
examine internal scan report results or other
documentation to verify that all other applicable
vulnerabilities (those not ranked as high-risk or
critical per the entity’s vulnerability risk rankings at
Requirement 6.3.1) are addressed based on the
risk defined in the entity’s targeted risk analysis,
and that the scan process includes rescans as
needed to confirm the vulnerabilities have been
addressed.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Lower ranked vulnerabilities (lower than high or
critical) are addressed at a frequency in accordance
with the entity’s risk.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
The timeframe for addressing lower-risk
vulnerabilities is subject to the results of a risk
analysis per Requirement 12.3.1 that includes
(minimally) identification of assets being protected,
threats, and likelihood and/or impact of a threat
being realized.
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Authenticated scanning provides greater insight
into an entity’s vulnerability landscape since it can
detect vulnerabilities that unauthenticated scans
cannot detect. Attackers may leverage
vulnerabilities that an entity is unaware of
because certain vulnerabilities will only be
detected with authenticated scanning.
Authenticated scanning can yield significant
additional information about an organization’s
vulnerabilities.
Good Practice
The credentials used for these scans should be
considered highly privileged. They should be
protected and controlled as such, following PCI
DSS Requirements 7 and 8 (except for those
requirements for multi-factor authentication and
application and system accounts).
```
```
11.3.1.2 Internal vulnerability scans are performed
via authenticated scanning as follows:
```
- Systems that are unable to accept credentials for
    authenticated scanning are documented.
- Sufficient privileges are used for those systems
    that accept credentials for scanning.
- If accounts used for authenticated scanning can
    be used for interactive login, they are managed
    in accordance with Requirement 8.2.2.

```
11.3.1.2.a Examine scan tool configurations to
verify that authenticated scanning is used for
internal scans, with sufficient privileges, for those
systems that accept credentials for scanning.
```
```
11.3.1.2.b Examine scan report results and
interview personnel to verify that authenticated
scans are performed.
```
```
11.3.1.2.c If accounts used for authenticated
scanning can be used for interactive login,
examine the accounts and interview personnel to
verify the accounts are managed following all
elements specified in Requirement 8.2.2.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Automated tools used to detect vulnerabilities can
detect vulnerabilities local to each system, which
are not visible remotely.
```
```
11.3.1.2.d Examine documentation to verify that
systems that are unable to accept credentials for
authenticated scanning are defined.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
The authenticated scanning tools can be either
host-based or network-based.
“Sufficient” privileges are those needed to access
system resources such that a thorough scan can be
conducted that detects known vulnerabilities.
This requirement does not apply to system
components that cannot accept credentials for
scanning. Examples of systems that may not accept
credentials for scanning include some network and
security appliances, mainframes, and containers.
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

the change.
Good Practice
Entities should perform scans after significant
changes as part of the change process per
Requirement 6.5.2 and before considering the
change complete. All system components
affected by the change will need to be scanned.
```
```
11.3.1.3 Internal vulnerability scans are performed
after any significant change as follows:
```
- High-risk and critical vulnerabilities (per the

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Attackers routinely look for unpatched or
vulnerable externally facing servers, which can be
leveraged to launch a directed attack.
Organizations must ensure these externally facing
devices are regularly scanned for weaknesses
and that vulnerabilities are patched or remediated
to protect the entity.
Because external networks are at greater risk of
compromise, external vulnerability scanning must
be performed at least once every three months by
a PCI SSC Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV).
Good Practice
While scans are required at least once every
three months, more frequent scans are
recommended depending on the network
complexity, frequency of change, and types of
devices, software, and operating systems used.
Multiple scan reports can be combined to show
that all systems were scanned and that all
applicable vulnerabilities were resolved as part of
the three-month vulnerability scan cycle.
However, additional documentation may be
required to verify non-remediated vulnerabilities
are in the process of being resolved.
```
```
11.3.2 External vulnerability scans are performed as
follows:
```
- At least once every three months.
- By a PCI SSC Approved Scanning Vendor
    (ASV).
- Vulnerabilities are resolved and _ASV Program_
    _Guide_ requirements for a passing scan are met.
- Rescans are performed as needed to confirm
    that vulnerabilities are resolved per the _ASV_
    _Program Guide_ requirements for a passing
    scan.

```
11.3.2.a Examine ASV scan reports from the last
12 months to verify that external vulnerability scans
occurred at least once every three months in the
most recent 12-month period.

This requirement is not eligible for the customized
approach.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
For initial PCI DSS compliance, it is not required that
four passing scans be completed within 12 months if
the assessor verifies: 1) the most recent scan result
was a passing scan, 2) the entity has documented
policies and procedures requiring scanning at least
once every three months, and 3) vulnerabilities
noted in the scan results have been corrected as
shown in a re-scan(s).
(continued on next page)
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
However, for subsequent years after the initial PCI
DSS assessment, passing scans at least every three

ASV scanning tools can scan a vast array of
network types and topologies. Any specifics about
the target environment (for example, load balancers,
third-party providers, ISPs, specific configurations,
protocols in use, scan interference) should be
worked out between the ASV and scan customer.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Scanning an environment after any significant
changes ensures that changes were completed
appropriately such that the security of the
environment was not compromised because of
the change.
Good Practice
Entities should include the need to perform scans
after significant changes as part of the change
process and before the change is considered
complete. All system components affected by the
change will need to be scanned.
```
```
11.3.2.1 External vulnerability scans are performed
after any significant change as follows:
```
- Vulnerabilities that are scored 4.0 or higher by
    the CVSS are resolved.
- Rescans are conducted as needed.
- Scans are performed by qualified personnel and
    organizational independence of the tester exists
    (not required to be a QSA or ASV).

```
11.3.2.1.a Examine change control documentation
and external scan reports to verify that system
components were scanned after any significant
changes.
```
```
11.3.2.1.b Interview personnel and examine
external scan and rescan reports to verify that
external scans were performed after significant
changes and that vulnerabilities scored 4.0 or
higher by the CVSS were resolved.
```
```
11.3.2.1.c Interview personnel to verify that
external scans are performed by a qualified
internal resource(s) or qualified external third party
and that organizational independence of the tester
exists.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The security posture of all system components is
verified following significant changes to the network
or systems, by using tools designed to detect
vulnerabilities operating from outside the network.
Detected vulnerabilities are assessed and rectified
based on a formal risk assessment framework.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
11.4 External and internal penetration testing is regularly performed, and exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses are corrected.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Attackers spend a lot of time finding external and
internal vulnerabilities to leverage to obtain
access to cardholder data and then to exfiltrate
that data. As such, entities need to test their
networks thoroughly, just as an attacker would do.
This testing allows the entity to identify and
remediate weakness that might be leveraged to
compromise the entity’s network and data, and
then to take appropriate actions to protect the
network and system components from such
attacks.
Good Practice
Penetration testing techniques will differ based on
an organization’s needs and structure and should
be suitable for the tested environment—for
example, fuzzing, injection, and forgery tests
might be appropriate. The type, depth, and
complexity of the testing will depend on the
specific environment and the needs of the
organization.
Definitions
Penetration tests simulate a real-world attack
situation intending to identify how far an attacker
could penetrate an environment, given differing
amounts of information provided to the tester.
This allows an entity to better understand its
potential exposure and develop a strategy to
defend against attacks. A penetration test differs
from a vulnerability scan, as a penetration test is
an active process that usually includes exploiting
identified vulnerabilities.
```

11.4.1 A penetration testing methodology is defined,
documented, and implemented by the entity, and
includes:
```
- Industry-accepted penetration testing
    approaches.
- Coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and
    critical systems.
- Testing from both inside and outside the
    network.
- Testing to validate any segmentation and scope-
    reduction controls.
- Application-layer penetration testing to identify,
    at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in
    Requirement 6.2.4.
- Network-layer penetration tests that encompass
    all components that support network functions as
    well as operating systems.
- Review and consideration of threats and
    vulnerabilities experienced in the last 12 months.
- Documented approach to assessing and
    addressing the risk posed by exploitable
    vulnerabilities and security weaknesses found
    during penetration testing.
- Retention of penetration testing results and
    remediation activities results for at least 12
    months.

```
11.4.1 Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify that the penetration-testing
methodology defined, documented, and
implemented by the entity includes all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
A formal methodology is defined for thorough
technical testing that attempts to exploit
vulnerabilities and security weaknesses via
simulated attack methods by a competent manual
attacker.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Applicability Notes^ Scanning for vulnerabilities alone is not a
penetration test, nor is a penetration test
adequate if the focus is solely on trying to exploit
vulnerabilities found in a vulnerability scan.
Conducting a vulnerability scan may be one of the
first steps, but it is not the only step a penetration
tester will perform to plan the testing strategy.
Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known
vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often
gain enough knowledge about the system to
identify possible security gaps.
Penetration testing is a highly manual process.
While some automated tools may be used, the
tester uses their knowledge of systems to gain
access into an environment. Often the tester will
chain several types of exploits together with the
goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For
example, if the tester finds a way to gain access
to an application server, the tester will then use
the compromised server as a point to stage a new
attack based on the resources to which the server
has access. In this way, a tester can simulate the
techniques used by an attacker to identify areas
of potential weakness in the environment. The
testing of security monitoring and detection
methods—for example, to confirm the
effectiveness of logging and file integrity
monitoring mechanisms, should also be
considered.

Testing from inside the network (or “internal
penetration testing”) means testing from both inside
the CDE and into the CDE from trusted and
untrusted internal networks.
Testing from outside the network (or “external
penetration testing”) means testing the exposed
external perimeter of trusted networks, and critical
systems connected to or accessible to public
network infrastructures.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose
Internal penetration testing serves two purposes.
Firstly, just like an external penetration test, it
discovers vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
that could be used by an attacker that had
managed to get some degree of access to the
internal network, whether that is because the
attacker is an authorized user conducting
unauthorized activities, or an external attacker
that had managed to penetrate the entity’s
perimeter.
Secondly, internal penetration testing also helps
entities to discover where their change control
process failed by detecting previously unknown
systems. Additionally, it verifies the status of
many of the controls operating within the CDE.
A penetration test is not truly a “test” because the
outcome of a penetration test is not something
that can be classified as a “pass” or a “fail.” The
best outcome of a test is a catalog of
vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that an entity
did not know about and the penetration tester
found them before an attacker could. A
penetration test that found nothing is typically
indicative of shortcomings of the penetration
tester, rather than being a positive reflection of
the security posture of the entity.
Good Practice
Some considerations when choosing a qualified
resource to perform penetration testing include:
```
- Specific penetration testing certifications,
    which may be an indication of the tester’s skill
    level and competence.

```
(continued on next page)
```
```
11.4.2 Internal penetration testing is performed:
```
- Per the entity’s defined methodology,
- At least once every 12 months
- After any significant infrastructure or application
    upgrade or change
- By a qualified internal resource or qualified
    external third-party
- Organizational independence of the tester exists
    (not required to be a QSA or ASV).

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The results of a penetration test are usually a
prioritized list of vulnerabilities discovered by the
exercise. Often a tester will have chained a
number of vulnerabilities together to compromise
a system component. Remediating the
vulnerabilities found by a penetration test
significantly reduces the probability that the same
vulnerabilities will be exploited by a malicious
attacker.
Using the entity’s own vulnerability risk
assessment process (see requirement 6.3.1)
ensures that the vulnerabilities that pose the
highest risk to the entity will be remediated more
quickly.
Good Practice
As part of the entity’s assessment of risk, entities
should consider how likely the vulnerability is to
be exploited and whether there are other controls
present in the environment to reduce the risk.
Any weaknesses that point to PCI DSS
requirements not being met should be addressed.
```
```
11.4.4 Exploitable vulnerabilities and security
weaknesses found during penetration testing are
corrected as follows:
```
- In accordance with the entity’s assessment of
    the risk posed by the security issue as defined in
    Requirement 6.3.1.
- Penetration testing is repeated to verify the
    corrections.

```

that noted exploitable vulnerabilities and security
weaknesses were corrected in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
When an entity uses segmentation controls to
isolate the CDE from internal untrusted networks,
the security of the CDE is dependent on that
segmentation functioning. Many attacks have
involved the attacker moving laterally from what
an entity deemed an isolated network into the
CDE. Using penetration testing tools and
techniques to validate that an untrusted network
is indeed isolated from the CDE can alert the
entity to a failure or misconfiguration of the
segmentation controls, which can then be
rectified.
Good Practice
Techniques such as host discovery and port
scanning can be used to verify out-of-scope
segments have no access to the CDE.
```
```
11.4.5 If segmentation is used to isolate the CDE
from other networks, penetration tests are
performed on segmentation controls as follows:
```
- At least once every 12 months and after any
    changes to segmentation controls/methods
- Covering all segmentation controls/methods in
    use.
- According to the entity’s defined penetration
    testing methodology.
- Confirming that the segmentation
    controls/methods are operational and effective,
    and isolate the CDE from all out-of-scope
    systems.
- Confirming effectiveness of any use of isolation
    to separate systems with differing security levels
    (see Requirement 2.2.3).
- Performed by a qualified internal resource or
    qualified external third party.
- Organizational independence of the tester exists
    (not required to be a QSA or ASV).

```
Customized Approach Objective

```
If segmentation is used, it is verified periodically by
technical testing to be continually effective, including
after any changes, in isolating the CDE from all out-
of-scope systems.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Service providers typically have access to greater
volumes of cardholder data or can provide an
entry point that can be exploited to then
compromise multiple other entities. Service
providers also typically have larger and more
complex networks that are subject to more
frequent change. The probability of segmentation
controls failing in complex and dynamic networks
is greater in service provider environments.
Validating segmentation controls more frequently
is likely to discover such failings before they can
be exploited by an attacker attempting to pivot
laterally from an out-of-scope untrusted network
to the CDE.
Good Practice
Although the requirement specifies that this scope
validation is carried out at least once every six
months and after significant change, this exercise
should be performed as frequently as possible to
ensure it remains effective at isolating the CDE
from other networks.
```
```
11.4.6 Additional requirement for service
providers only: If segmentation is used to isolate
the CDE from other networks, penetration tests are
performed on segmentation controls as follows:

- At least once every six months and after any
    changes to segmentation controls/methods.
- Covering all segmentation controls/methods in

- Confirming that the segmentation
controls/methods are operational and effective,

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Entities need to conduct penetration tests in
accordance with PCI DSS to simulate attacker
behavior and discover vulnerabilities in their
environment. In shared and cloud environments,
the multi-tenant service provider may be
concerned about the activities of a penetration
tester affecting other customers’ systems.
Multi-tenant service providers cannot forbid
penetration testing because this would leave their
customers’ systems open to exploitation.
Therefore, multi-tenant service providers must
support customer requests to conduct penetration
testing or for penetration testing results.

    according to Requirements 11.4.3 and 11.4.4 on
    the customers’ subscribed infrastructure, or
- Provide prompt access to each of its customers,
    so customers can perform their own penetration
    testing.
Evidence provided to customers can include
redacted penetration testing results but needs to
include sufficient information to prove that all
elements of Requirements 11.4.3 and 11.4.4 have
been met on the customer’s behalf.
Refer also to _Appendix A1: Additional PCI DSS

11.5 Network intrusions and unexpected file changes are detected and responded to.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention
techniques (such as IDS/IPS) compare the traffic
coming into the network with known “signatures”
and/or behaviors of thousands of compromise
types (hacker tools, Trojans, and other malware),
and then send alerts and/or stop the attempt as it
happens. Without a proactive approach to detect
unauthorized activity, attacks on (or misuse of)
computer resources could go unnoticed for long
periods of time. The impact of an intrusion into the
CDE is, in many ways, a factor of the time that an
attacker has in the environment before being
detected.
(continued on next page)
```
```
11.5.1 Intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-
prevention techniques are used to detect and/or
prevent intrusions into the network as follows:
```
- All traffic is monitored at the perimeter of the
    CDE.
- All traffic is monitored at critical points in the
    CDE.
- Personnel are alerted to suspected
    compromises.
- All intrusion-detection and prevention engines,
    baselines, and signatures are kept up to date.

```
11.5.1.a Examine system configurations and
network diagrams to verify that intrusion-detection
and/or intrusion-prevention techniques are in place
to monitor all traffic:
```
- At the perimeter of the CDE.
- At critical points in the CDE.

```
11.5.1.b Examine system configurations and
interview responsible personnel to verify intrusion-
detection and/or intrusion-prevention techniques
alert personnel of suspected compromises.

vendor documentation to verify intrusion-detection
and/or intrusion-prevention techniques are
configured to keep all engines, baselines, and

```
Good Practice
Security alerts generated by these techniques
should be continually monitored, so that the
attempted or actual intrusions can be stopped,
and potential damage limited.
Definitions
Critical locations could include, but are not limited
to, network security controls between network
segments (for example, between a DMZ and an
internal network or between an in-scope and out-
of-scope network) and points protecting
connections between a less trusted and a more
trusted system component.
```
```
Mechanisms to detect real-time suspicious or
anomalous network traffic that may be indicative of
threat actor activity are implemented. Alerts
generated by these mechanisms are responded to
by personnel, or by automated means that ensure
that system components cannot be compromised as
a result of the detected activity.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Detecting covert malware communication
attempts (for example, DNS tunneling) can help
block the spread of malware laterally inside a
network and the exfiltration of data. When
deciding where to place this control, entities
should consider critical locations in the network,
and likely routes for covert channels.
When malware establishes a foothold in an
infected environment, it often tries to establish a
communication channel to a command-and-
control (C&C) server. Through the C&C server,
the attacker communicates with and controls
malware on compromised systems to deliver
malicious payloads or instructions, or to initiate
data exfiltration. In many cases, the malware will
communicate with the C&C server indirectly via
botnets, bypassing monitoring, blocking controls,
and rendering these methods ineffective to detect
the covert channels.
Good Practice
Methods that can help detect and address
malware communications channels include real-
time endpoint scanning, egress traffic filtering, an
”allow” listing, data loss prevention tools, and
network security monitoring tools such as
IDS/IPS. Additionally, DNS queries and
responses are a key data source used by network
defenders in support of incident response as well
as intrusion discovery. When these transactions
are collected for processing and analytics, they
can enable a number of valuable security analytic
scenarios.
It is important that organizations maintain up-to-
date knowledge of malware modes of operation,
as mitigating these can help detect and limit the
impact of malware in the environment.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Changes to critical system, configuration, or
content files can be an indicator an attacker has
accessed an organization’s system. Such
changes can allow an attacker to take additional
malicious actions, access cardholder data, and/or
conduct activities without detection or record.
A change detection mechanism will detect and
evaluate such changes to critical files and
generate alerts that can be responded to following
defined processes so that personnel can take
appropriate actions.
If not implemented properly and the output of the
change-detection solution monitored, a malicious
individual could add, remove, or alter
configuration file contents, operating system
programs, or application executables.
Unauthorized changes, if undetected, could
render existing security controls ineffective and/or
result in cardholder data being stolen with no
perceptible impact to normal processing.
Good Practice
Examples of the types of files that should be
monitored include, but are not limited to:
```
- System executables.
- Application executables.
- Configuration and parameter files.
- Centrally stored, historical, or archived audit
    logs.
- Additional critical files determined by entity (for
    example, through risk assessment or other
    means).
**Examples**
Change-detection solutions such as file integrity
monitoring (FIM) tools check for changes,
additions, and deletions to critical files, and notify
when such changes are detected.

```
11.5.2 A change-detection mechanism (for example,
file integrity monitoring tools) is deployed as follows:
```
- To alert personnel to unauthorized modification
    (including changes, additions, and deletions) of
    critical files.
- To perform critical file comparisons at least
    once weekly.

```
11.5.2.a Examine system settings, monitored files,
and results from monitoring activities to verify the
use of a change-detection mechanism.

usually those that do not regularly change, but the
modification of which could indicate a system
compromise or risk of compromise. Change-
detection mechanisms such as file integrity
monitoring products usually come pre-configured
with critical files for the related operating system.
Other critical files, such as those for custom
applications, must be evaluated and defined by the
entity (that is, the merchant or service provider).

11.6 Unauthorized changes on payment pages are detected and responded to.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Many web pages now rely on assembling objects,
including active content (primarily JavaScript),
from multiple internet locations. Additionally, the
content of many web pages is defined using
content management and tag management
systems that may not be possible to monitor using
traditional change detection mechanisms.
Therefore, the only place to detect changes or
indicators of malicious activity is in the consumer
browser as the page is constructed and all
JavaScript interpreted.
By comparing the current version of the HTTP
header and the active content of payment pages
as received by the consumer browser with prior or
known versions, it is possible to detect
unauthorized changes that may indicate a
skimming attack.
Additionally, by looking for known indicators of
compromise and script elements or behavior
typical of skimmers, suspicious alerts can be
raised.
(continued on next page)
```
```
11.6.1 A change- and tamper-detection mechanism
is deployed as follows:
```
- To alert personnel to unauthorized modification
    (including indicators of compromise, changes,
    additions, and deletions) to the HTTP headers
    and the contents of payment pages as received
    by the consumer browser.
- The mechanism is configured to evaluate the
    received HTTP header and payment page.
- The mechanism functions are performed as
    follows:
       - At least once every seven days
          **OR**
       - Periodically (at the frequency defined in the
          entity’s targeted risk analysis, which is
          performed according to all elements
          specified in Requirement 12.3.1).

```
11.6.1.a Examine system settings, monitored
payment pages, and results from monitoring
activities to verify the use of a change- and tamper-
detection mechanism.
```
```
11.6.1.b Examine configuration settings to verify
the mechanism is configured in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
11.6.1.c If the mechanism functions are performed
at an entity-defined frequency, examine the entity’s
targeted risk analysis for determining the frequency
to verify the risk analysis was performed in
accordance with all elements specified at
Requirement 12.3.1.
```
```
11.6.1.d Examine configuration settings and
interview personnel to verify the mechanism
functions are performed either:
```
- At least once every seven days
    **OR**
- At the frequency defined in the entity’s targeted
    risk analysis performed for this requirement.

```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
E-commerce skimming code or techniques cannot
be added to payment pages as received by the
consumer browser without a timely alert being
generated. Anti-skimming measures cannot be
removed from payment pages without a prompt alert
being generated.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Applicability Notes^ Examples^
Mechanisms that detect and report on changes to
the headers and content of the payment page
include but are not limited to:
```
- Violations of the Content Security Policy (CSP)
    can be reported to the entity using the _report-_
    _to_ or _report-uri_ CSP directives.
- Changes to the CSP itself can indicate
    tampering.
- External monitoring by systems that request
    and analyze the received web pages (also
    known as synthetic user monitoring) can
    detect changes to JavaScript in payment
    pages and alert personnel.
- Embedding tamper-resistant, tamper-detection
    script in the payment page can alert and block
    when malicious script behavior is detected.
- Reverse proxies and Content Delivery
    Networks can detect changes in scripts and
    alert personnel.
Often, these mechanisms are subscription or
cloud-based, but can also be based on custom
and bespoke solutions.

```
The intention of this requirement is not that an entity
installs software in the systems or browsers of its
consumers, but rather that the entity uses
techniques such as those described under
Examples in the Guidance column to prevent and
detect unexpected script activities.
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

### Maintain an Information Security Policy

**_Requirement 12: Support Information Security with Organizational Policies and Programs_**

```
Sections
```
```
12.1 A comprehensive information security policy that governs and provides direction for protection of the entity’s information assets is known
and current.
12.2 Acceptable use policies for end-user technologies are defined and implemented.
12.3 Risks to the cardholder data environment are formally identified, evaluated, and managed.
12.4 PCI DSS compliance is managed.
12.5 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.
12.6 Security awareness education is an ongoing activity.
12.7 Personnel are screened to reduce risks from insider threats.
12.8 Risk to information assets associated with third-party service provider (TPSP) relationships is managed.
12.9 Third-party service providers (TPSPs) support their customers’ PCI DSS compliance.
12.10 Suspected and confirmed security incidents that could impact the CDE are responded to immediately.
```
```
Overview
```
```
The organization’s overall information security policy sets the tone for the whole entity and informs personnel what is expected of them. All
personnel should be aware of the sensitivity of cardholder data and their responsibilities for protecting it.
```
```
For the purposes of Requirement 12, “personnel” refers to full-time and part-time employees, temporary employees, contractors, and
consultants with security responsibilities for protecting account data or that can impact the security of account data.
Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
12.1 A comprehensive information security policy that governs and provides direction for protection of the entity’s information assets is known and current.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
An organization’s overall information security
policy ties to and governs all other policies and
procedures that define protection of cardholder
data.
The information security policy communicates
management’s intent and objectives regarding the
protection of its most valuable assets, including
cardholder data.
Without an information security policy, individuals
will make their own value decisions on the
controls that are required within the organization
which may result in the organization neither
meeting its legal, regulatory, and contractual
obligations, nor being able to adequately protect
its assets in a consistent manner.
To ensure the policy is implemented, it is
important that all relevant personnel within the
organization, as well as relevant third parties,
vendors, and business partners are aware of the
organization’s information security policy and their
responsibilities for protecting information assets.
(continued on next page)
```
```
12.1.1 An overall information security policy is:
```
- Established.
- Published.
- Maintained.
- Disseminated to all relevant personnel, as well
    as to relevant vendors and business partners.

```
12.1.1 Examine the information security policy and
interview personnel to verify that the overall
information security policy is managed in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The strategic objectives and principles of
information security are defined, adopted, and
known to all personnel.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Good Practice
The security policy for the organization identifies
the purpose, scope, accountability, and
information that clearly defines the organization’s
position regarding information security.
The overall information security policy differs from
individual security policies that address specific
technology or security disciplines. This policy sets
forth the directives for the entire organization
whereas individual security policies align and
support the overall security policy and
communicate specific objectives for technology or
security disciplines.
It is important that all relevant personnel within
the organization, as well as relevant third parties,
vendors, and business partners are aware of the
organization’s information security policy and their
responsibilities for protecting information assets.
Definitions
“Relevant” for this requirement means that the
information security policy is disseminated to
those with roles applicable to some or all the
topics in the policy, either within the company or
because of services/functions performed by a
vendor or third party.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Security threats and associated protection
methods evolve rapidly. Without updating the
information security policy to reflect relevant
changes, new measures to defend against these
threats may not be addressed.
```
```
12.1.2 The information security policy is:
```
- Reviewed at least once every 12 months.
- Updated as needed to reflect changes to
    business objectives or risks to the environment.

```
12.1.2 Examine the information security policy and
interview responsible personnel to verify the policy
is managed in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The information security policy continues to reflect
the organization’s strategic objectives and
principles.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without clearly defined security roles and
responsibilities assigned, there could be misuse
of the organization’s information assets or
inconsistent interaction with information security
personnel, leading to insecure implementation of
technologies or use of outdated or insecure
technologies.
```
```
12.1.3 The security policy clearly defines
information security roles and responsibilities for all
personnel, and all personnel are aware of and
acknowledge their information security
responsibilities.
```
```
12.1.3.a Examine the information security policy to
verify that they clearly define information security
roles and responsibilities for all personnel.
```
```
12.1.3.b Interview personnel in various roles to
verify they understand their information security
responsibilities.
```
```
12.1.3.c Examine documented evidence to verify
personnel acknowledge their information security
Customized Approach Objective responsibilities.^
```
```
Personnel understand their role in protecting the
entity’s cardholder data.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose
To ensure someone with sufficient authority and
responsibility is actively managing and
championing the organization’s information
security program, accountability and responsibility
for information security needs to be assigned at
the executive level within an organization.
Common executive management titles for this
role include Chief Information Security Officer
(CISO) and Chief Security Officer (CSO – to meet
this requirement, the CSO role must be
responsible for information security). These
positions are often at the most senior level of
management and are part of the chief executive
level or C-level, typically reporting to the Chief
Executive Officer or the Board of Directors.
Good Practice
Entities should also consider transition and/or
succession plans for these key personnel to avoid
potential gaps in critical security activities.
```
```
12.1.4 Responsibility for information security is
formally assigned to a Chief Information Security
Officer or other information security knowledgeable
member of executive management.
```
```
12.1.4 Examine the information security policy to
verify that information security is formally assigned
to a Chief Information Security Officer or other
information security-knowledgeable member of
executive management.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
A designated member of executive management is
responsible for information security.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
12.2 Acceptable use policies for end-user technologies are defined and implemented.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
End-user technologies are a significant
investment and may pose significant risk to an
organization if not managed properly. Acceptable
use policies outline the expected behavior from
personnel when using the organization’s
information technology and reflect the
organization’s risk tolerance
These policies instruct personnel on what they
can and cannot do with company equipment and
instruct personnel on correct and incorrect uses of
company Internet and email resources. Such
policies can legally protect an organization and
allow it to act when the policies are violated.
Good Practice
It is important that usage policies are supported
by technical controls to manage the enforcement
of the policies.
Structuring polices as simple “do” and “do not”
requirements that are linked to a purpose can
help remove ambiguity and provide personnel
with the context for the requirement.
```
```
12.2.1 Acceptable use policies for end-user
technologies are documented and implemented,
including:
```
- Explicit approval by authorized parties.
- Acceptable uses of the technology.
- List of products approved by the company for
    employee use, including hardware and software.

```
12.2.1 Examine the acceptable use policies for
end-user technologies and interview responsible
personnel to verify processes are documented and
implemented in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The use of end-user technologies is defined and
managed to ensure authorized usage.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
Examples of end-user technologies for which
acceptable use policies are expected include, but
are not limited to, remote access and wireless
technologies, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, and
removable electronic media, email usage, and
Internet usage.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
12.3 Risks to the cardholder data environment are formally identified, evaluated, and managed.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Some PCI DSS requirements allow an entity to
define how frequently an activity is performed
based on the risk to environment. Performing this
risk analysis according to a methodology ensures
validity and consistency with policies and
procedures.
This targeted risk analysis (as opposed to a
traditional enterprise-wide risk assessment)
focuses on those PCI DSS requirements that
all ow an entity flexibility about how frequently an
entity performs a given control. For this risk
analysis, the entity carefully evaluates each PCI
DSS requirement that provides this flexibility and
determines the frequency that supports adequate
security for the entity, and the level of risk the
entity is willing to accept.
The risk analysis identifies the specific assets,
such as the system components and data—for
example, log files, or credentials—that the
requirement is intended to protect, as well as the
threat(s) or outcomes that the requirement is
protecting the assets from—for example,
malware, an undetected intruder, or misuse of
credentials. Examples of factors that could
contribute to likelihood or impact include any that
could increase the vulnerability of an asset to a
threat—for example, exposure to untrusted
networks, complexity of environment, or high staff
turnover—as well as the criticality of the system
components, or volume and sensitivity of the
data, being protected.
(continued on next page)
```
```
12.3.1 Each PCI DSS requirement that provides
flexibility for how frequently it is performed (for
example, requirements to be performed periodically)
is supported by a targeted risk analysis that is
documented and includes:
```
- Identification of the assets being protected.
- Identification of the threat(s) that the requirement
    is protecting against.
- Identification of factors that contribute to the
    likelihood and/or impact of a threat being
    realized.
- Resulting analysis that determines, and includes
    justification for, how frequently the requirement
    must be performed to minimize the likelihood of
    the threat being realized.
- Review of each targeted risk analysis at least
    once every 12 months to determine whether the
    results are still valid or if an updated risk analysis
    is needed.
- Performance of updated risk analyses when
    needed, as determined by the annual review.

```
12.3.1 Examine documented policies and
procedures to verify a process is defined for
performing targeted risk analyses for each PCI
DSS requirement that provides flexibility for how
frequently the requirement is performed, and that
the process includes all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Up to date knowledge and assessment of risks to
the CDE are maintained.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Reviewing the results of these targeted risk
analyses at least once every 12 months and upon
changes that could impact the risk to the
environment allows the organization to ensure the
risk analysis results remain current with
organizational changes and evolving threats,
trends, and technologies, and that the selected
frequencies still adequately address the entity’s
risk.
Good Practice
An enterprise-wide risk assessment, which is a
point-in-time activity that enables entities to
identify threats and associated vulnerabilities, is
recommended, but is not required, for entities to
determine and understand broader and emerging
threats with the potential to negatively impact its
business. This enterprise-wide risk assessment
could be established as part of an overarching
risk management program that is used as an
input to the annual review of an organization's
overall information security policy (see
Requirement 12.1.1).
Examples of risk-assessment methodologies for
enterprise-wide risk assessments include, but are
not limited to, ISO 27005 and NIST SP 800-30.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
A risk analysis following a repeatable and robust
methodology enables an entity to meet the
customized approach objective.
Definitions
The customized approach to meeting a PCI DSS
requirement allows entities to define the controls
used to meet a given requirement’s stated
Customized Approach Objective in a way that
does not strictly follow the defined requirement.
These controls are expected to at least meet or
exceed the security provided by the defined
requirement and require extensive documentation
by the entity using the customized approach.
Further Information
See Appendix D: Customized Approach for
instructions on how to document the required
evidence for the customized approach.
See Appendix E Sample Templates to Support
Customized Approach for templates that entities
may use to document their customized controls.
Note that while use of the templates is optional,
the information specified within each template
must be documented and provided to each
entity’s assessor.
```
```
12.3.2 A targeted risk analysis is performed for each
PCI DSS requirement that the entity meets with the
customized approach, to include:
```
- Documented evidence detailing each element
    specified in Appendix D: Customized Approach
    (including, at a minimum, a controls matrix and
    risk analysis).
- Approval of documented evidence by senior
    management.
- Performance of the targeted analysis of risk at
    least once every 12 months.

```
12.3.2 Examine the documented targeted risk-
analysis for each PCI DSS requirement that the
entity meets with the customized approach to verify
that documentation for each requirement exists
and is in accordance with all elements specified in
this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
This requirement is part of the customized approach
and must be met for those using the customized
approach.
```

This requirement only applies to entities using a
Customized Approach.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Protocols and encryption strengths may quickly
change or be deprecated due to identification of
vulnerabilities or design flaws. In order to support
current and future data security needs, entities
need to know where cryptography is used and
understand how they would be able to respond
rapidly to changes impacting the strength of their
cryptographic implementations.
Good Practice
Cryptographic agility is important to ensure an
alternative to the original encryption method or
cryptographic primitive is available, with plans to
upgrade to the alternative without significant
change to system infrastructure. For example, if
the entity is aware of when protocols or
algorithms will be deprecated by standards
bodies, it can make proactive plans to upgrade
before the deprecation is impactful to operations.
Definitions
“Cryptographic agility” refers to the ability to
monitor and manage the encryption and related
verification technologies deployed across an
organization.

12.3.3 Cryptographic cipher suites and protocols in
use are documented and reviewed at least once
every 12 months, including at least the following:
```
- An up-to-date inventory of all cryptographic
    cipher suites and protocols in use, including
    purpose and where used.
- Active monitoring of industry trends regarding
    continued viability of all cryptographic cipher
    suites and protocols in use.
- A documented strategy to respond to anticipated
    changes in cryptographic vulnerabilities.

```
12.3.3 Examine documentation for cryptographic
suites and protocols in use and interview personnel
to verify the documentation and review is in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.

Customized Approach Objective
```
```
The entity is able to respond quickly to any
vulnerabilities in cryptographic protocols or
algorithms, where those vulnerabilities affect
protection of cardholder data.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
The requirement applies to all cryptographic suites
and protocols used to meet PCI DSS requirements.
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March
2025, after which it will be required and must be
fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Hardware and software technologies are
constantly evolving, and organizations need to be
aware of changes to the technologies they use,
as well as the evolving threats to those
technologies to ensure that they can prepare for,
and manage, vulnerabilities in hardware and
software that will not be remediated by the vendor
or developer.
Good Practice
Organizations should review firmware versions to
ensure they remain current and supported by the
vendors. Organizations also need to be aware of
changes made by technology vendors to their
products or processes to understand how such
changes may impact the organization’s use of the
technology.
Regular reviews of technologies that impact or
influence PCI DSS controls can assist with
purchasing, usage, and deployment strategies,
and ensure controls that rely on those
technologies remain effective. These reviews
include, but are not limited to, reviewing
technologies that are no longer supported by the
vendor and/or no longer meet the security needs
of the organization.
```
```
12.3.4 Hardware and software technologies in use
are reviewed at least once every 12 months,
including at least the following:
```
- Analysis that the technologies continue to
    receive security fixes from vendors promptly.
- Analysis that the technologies continue to
    support (and do not preclude) the entity’s PCI
    DSS compliance.
- Documentation of any industry announcements
    or trends related to a technology, such as when
    a vendor has announced “end of life” plans for a
    technology.
- Documentation of a plan, approved by senior
    management, to remediate outdated
    technologies, including those for which vendors
    have announced “end of life” plans.

```
12.3.4 Examine documentation for the review of
hardware and software technologies in use and
interview personnel to verify that the review is in
accordance with all elements specified in this
requirement.
```

```
```
12.4.1 Additional requirement for service
providers only: Responsibility is established by
executive management for the protection of
cardholder data and a PCI DSS compliance
program to include:
```
- Overall accountability for maintaining PCI DSS
    compliance.
- Defining a charter for a PCI DSS compliance
    program and communication to executive
    management.

```
12.4.1 Additional testing procedure for service
provider assessments only: Examine
documentation to verify that executive
management has established responsibility for the
protection of cardholder data and a PCI DSS
compliance program in accordance with all
elements specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Executives are responsible and accountable for
security of cardholder data.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement applies only when the entity being
assessed is a service provider.
Executive management may include C-level
positions, board of directors, or equivalent. The
specific titles will depend on the particular
organizational structure.
Responsibility for the PCI DSS compliance program
may be assigned to individual roles and/or to
business units within the organization.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Regularly confirming that security policies and
procedures are being followed provides
assurance that the expected controls are active
and working as intended. This requirement is
distinct from other requirements that specify a
task to be performed. The objective of these
reviews is not to reperform other PCI DSS
requirements, but to confirm that security
activities are being performed on an ongoing
basis.
Good Practice
These reviews can also be used to verify that
appropriate evidence is being maintained—for
example, audit logs, vulnerability scan reports,
reviews of network security control rulesets—to
assist in the entity’s preparation for its next PCI
DSS assessment.
Examples
Looking at Requirement 1.2.7 as one example,
Requirement 12.4.2 is met by confirming, at least
once every three months, that reviews of
configurations of network security controls have
occurred at the required frequency. On the other
hand, Requirement 1.2.7 is met by reviewing
those configurations as specified in the
requirement.
```
```
12.4.2 Additional requirement for service
providers only: Reviews are performed at least
once every three months to confirm that personnel
are performing their tasks in accordance with all
security policies and operational procedures.
Reviews are performed by personnel other than
those responsible for performing the given task and
include, but are not limited to, the following tasks:
```
- Daily log reviews.
- Configuration reviews for network security
    controls.
- Applying configuration standards to new
    systems.
- Responding to security alerts.
- Change-management processes.

```
12.4.2.a Additional testing procedure for
service provider assessments only: Examine
policies and procedures to verify that processes
are defined for conducting reviews to confirm that
personnel are performing their tasks in accordance

12.5 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Maintaining a current list of all system
components will enable an organization to define
the scope of its environment and implement PCI
DSS requirements accurately and efficiently.
Without an inventory, some system components
could be overlooked and be inadvertently
excluded from the organization’s configuration
standards.
Good Practice
If an entity keeps an inventory of all assets, those
system components in scope for PCI DSS should
be clearly identifiable among the other assets.
Inventories should include containers or images
that may be instantiated.
Assigning an owner to the inventory helps to
ensure the inventory stays current.
Examples
Methods to maintain an inventory include as a
database, as a series of files, or in an inventory-
management tool.
```
```
12.5.1 An inventory of system components that are
in scope for PCI DSS, including a description of
function/use, is maintained and kept current.
```
```
12.5.1.a Examine the inventory to verify it includes
all in-scope system components and a description
of function/use for each.
```
```
12.5.1.b Interview personnel to verify the inventory
is kept current.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
All system components in scope for PCI DSS are
identified and known.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Frequent validation of PCI DSS scope helps to
ensure PCI DSS scope remains up to date and
aligned with changing business objectives, and
therefore that security controls are protecting all
appropriate system components.
Good Practice
Accurate scoping involves critically evaluating the
CDE and all connected system components to
determine the necessary coverage for PCI DSS
requirements. Scoping activities, including careful
analysis and ongoing monitoring, help to ensure
that in-scope systems are appropriately secured.
When documenting account data locations, the
entity can consider creating a table or
spreadsheet that includes the following
information:
```
- Data stores (databases, files, cloud, etc.),
    including the purpose of data storage and the
    retention period,
- Which CHD elements are stored (PAN, expiry
    date, cardholder name, and/or any elements
    of SAD prior to completion of authorization),
- How data is secured (type of encryption and
    strength, hashing algorithm and strength,
    truncation, tokenization),
- How access to data stores is logged,
    including a description of logging
    mechanism(s) in use (enterprise solution,
    application level, operating system level,
    etc.).
_(continued on next page)_

```
12.5.2 PCI DSS scope is documented and
confirmed by the entity at least once every 12
months and upon significant change to the in-scope
environment. At a minimum, the scoping validation
includes:
```
- Identifying all data flows for the various payment
    stages (for example, authorization, capture
    settlement, chargebacks, and refunds) and
    acceptance channels (for example, card-present,
    card-not-present, and e-commerce).
- Updating all data-flow diagrams per
    Requirement 1.2.4.
- Identifying all locations where account data is
    stored, processed, and transmitted, including but
    not limited to: 1) any locations outside of the
    currently defined CDE, 2) applications that
    process CHD, 3) transmissions between
    systems and networks, and 4) file backups.
- Identifying all system components in the CDE,
    connected to the CDE, or that could impact
    security of the CDE.
- Identifying all segmentation controls in use and
    the environment(s) from which the CDE is
    segmented, including justification for
    environments being out of scope.
- Identifying all connections from third-party
    entities with access to the CDE.
- Confirming that all identified data flows, account
    data, system components, segmentation
    controls, and connections from third parties with
    access to the CDE are included in scope.

```
12.5.2.a Examine documented results of scope
reviews and interview personnel to verify that the
reviews are performed:
```
- At least once every 12 months.
- After significant changes to the in-scope
    environment.

```
12.5.2.b Examine documented results of scope
reviews performed by the entity to verify that PCI
DSS scoping confirmation activity includes all
elements specified in this requirement.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Customized Approach Objective^ In addition to internal systems and networks, all
connections from third-party entities—for
example, business partners, entities providing
remote support services, and other service
providers—need to be identified to determine
inclusion for PCI DSS scope. Once the in-scope
connections have been identified, the applicable
PCI DSS controls can be implemented to reduce
the risk of a third-party connection being used to
compromise an entity’s CDE.
A data discovery tool or methodology can be used
to facilitate identifying all sources and locations of
PAN, and to look for PAN that resides on systems
and networks outside the currently defined CDE
or in unexpected places within the defined CDE—
for example, in an error log or memory dump file.
This approach can help ensure that previously
unknown locations of PAN are detected and that
the PAN is either eliminated or properly secured.

PCI DSS scope is verified periodically, and after
significant changes, by comprehensive analysis and
appropriate technical measures.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This annual confirmation of PCI DSS scope is an
activity expected to be performed by the entity
under assessment, and is not the same, nor is it
intended to be replaced by, the scoping confirmation
performed by the entity’s assessor during the
annual assessment.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Service providers typically have access to greater
volumes of cardholder data than do merchants, or
can provide an entry point that can be exploited to
then compromise multiple other entities. Service
providers also typically have larger and more
complex networks that are subject to more
frequent change. The probability of overlooked
changes to scope in complex and dynamic
networks is greater in service providers’
environments.
Validating PCI DSS scope more frequently is
likely to discover such overlooked changes before
they can be exploited by an attacker.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
An organization’s structure and management
define the requirements and protocol for effective
and secure operations. Changes to this structure
could have negative effects to existing controls
and frameworks by reallocating or removing
resources that once supported PCI DSS controls
or inheriting new responsibilities that may not
have established controls in place. Therefore, it is
important to revisit PCI DSS scope and controls
when there are changes to an organization’s
structure and management to ensure controls are
in place and active.
Examples
Changes to organizational structure include, but
are not limited to, company mergers or
acquisitions, and significant changes or
reassignments of personnel with responsibility for
security controls.
```

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Training of personnel ensures they receive the
information about the importance of information
security and that they understand their role in
protecting the organization.
Requiring an acknowledgment by personnel helps
ensure that they have read and understood the
security policies and procedures, and that they
have made and will continue to make a
commitment to comply with these policies.
Good Practice
Entities may incorporate new-hire training as part
of the Human Resources onboarding process.
Training should outline the security-related “dos”
and “don’ts.” Periodic refresher training reinforces
key security processes and procedures that may
be forgotten or bypassed.
Entities should consider requiring security
awareness training anytime personnel transfer
into roles where they can impact the security of
account data from roles where they did not have
this impact.
Methods and training content can vary, depending
on personnel roles.
Examples
Different methods that can be used to provide
security awareness and education include
posters, letters, web-based training, in-person
training, team meetings, and incentives.
Personnel acknowledgments may be recorded in
writing or electronically.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Educating personnel on how to detect, react to,
and report potential phishing and related attacks
and social engineering attempts is essential to
minimizing the probability of successful attacks.
Good Practice
An effective security awareness program should
include examples of phishing emails and periodic
testing to determine the prevalence of personnel
reporting such attacks. Training material an entity
can consider for this topic include:
```
- How to identify phishing and other social
    engineering attacks.
- How to react to suspected phishing and social
    engineering.
- Where and how to report suspected phishing
    and social engineering activity.
An emphasis on reporting allows the organization
to reward positive behavior, to optimize technical
defenses (see Requirement 5.4.1), and to take
immediate action to remove similar phishing
emails that evaded technical defenses from
recipient inboxes.

```
12.6.3.1 Security awareness training includes
awareness of threats and vulnerabilities that could
impact the security of the CDE, including but not

12.7 Personnel are screened to reduce risks from insider threats.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Performing thorough screening prior to hiring
potential personnel who are expected to be given
access to the CDE provides entities with the
information necessary to make informed risk
decisions regarding personnel they hire that will
have access to the CDE.
Other benefits of screening potential personnel
include helping to ensure workplace safety and
confirming information provided by prospective
employees on their resumes.
Good Practice
Entities should consider screening for existing
personnel anytime they transfer into roles where
they have access to the CDE from roles where
they did not have this access.
To be effective, the level of screening should be
appropriate for the position. For example,
positions requiring greater responsibility or that
have administrative access to critical data or
systems may warrant more detailed or more
frequent screening than positions with less
responsibility and access.
Examples
Screening options can include, as appropriate for
the entity’s region, previous employment history,
review of public information/social media
resources, criminal record, credit history, and
reference checks.
```

Different types of TPSPs include those that:
```
- Store, process, or transmit account data on
    the entity’s behalf (such as payment
    gateways, payment processors, payment
    service providers (PSPs), and off-site

    providers of network security control
    services, anti-malware services, and security
    incident and event management (SIEM);
    contact and call centers; web-hosting
    companies; and IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and
    FaaS cloud providers).
- Could impact the security of the entity’s CDE
    (such as vendors providing support via
    remote access, and bespoke software
    developers).

make an entity PCI DSS compliant, nor does it
remove the entity’s responsibility for its own PCI
DSS compliance.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The written acknowledgment from a TPSP
demonstrates its commitment to maintaining
proper security of account data that it obtains
from its customers and that the TPSP is fully
aware of the assets that could be affected during
the provisioning of the TPSP’s service. The extent
to which a specific TPSP is responsible for the
security of account data will depend on the
service provided and the agreement between the
provider and assessed entity (the customer).
In conjunction with Requirement 12.9.1, this
requirement is intended to promote a consistent
level of understanding between parties about their
applicable PCI DSS responsibilities. For example,
the agreement may include the applicable PCI
DSS requirements to be maintained as part of the
provided service.
Good Practice
The entity may also want to consider including in
their written agreement with a TPSP that the
TPSP will support the entity’s request for
information per Requirement 12.9.2. Entities will
also want to understand whether any TPSPs have
“nested” relationships with other TPSPs, meaning
the primary TPSP contracts with another TPSP(s)
for the purposes of providing a service.
It is important to understand whether the primary
TPSP is relying on the secondary TPSP(s) to
achieve overall compliance of a service, and what
types of written agreements the primary TPSP
has in place with the secondary TPSPs. Entities
can consider including coverage in their written
agreement for any “nested” TPSPs a primary
TPSP may use.

- Written agreements include acknowledgments
    from TPSPs that they are responsible for the
    security of account data the TPSPs possess or
    otherwise store, process, or transmit on behalf of
    the entity, or to the extent that they could impact
    the security of the entity’s CDE.

The exact wording of an acknowledgment will
depend on the agreement between the two parties,
the details of the service being provided, and the
responsibilities assigned to each party. The
acknowledgment does not have to include the exact
wording provided in this requirement.
Evidence that a TPSP is meeting PCI DSS
requirements (for example, a PCI DSS Attestation of
Compliance (AOC) or a declaration on a company’s
website) is not the same as a written agreement
specified in this requirement.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
A thorough process for engaging TPSPs,
including details for selection and vetting prior to
engagement, helps ensure that a TPSP is
thoroughly vetted internally by an entity prior to
establishing a formal relationship and that the risk
to cardholder data associated with the
engagement of the TPSP is understood.

Specific due-diligence processes and goals will
vary for each organization. Elements that should
be considered include the provider’s reporting
practices, breach-notification and incident
response procedures, details of how PCI DSS
responsibilities are assigned between each party,
how the TPSP validates their PCI DSS
compliance and what evidence they provide.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Knowing the PCI DSS compliance status of all
engaged TPSPs provides assurance and
awareness about whether they comply with the
requirements applicable to the services they offer
to the organization.
Good Practice
If the TPSP offers a variety of services, the
compliance status the entity monitors should be
specific to those services delivered to the entity
and those services in scope for the entity’s PCI
DSS assessment.
If a TPSP has a PCI DSS Attestation of
Compliance (AOC), the expectation is that the
TPSP should provide that to customers upon
request to demonstrate their PCI DSS compliance
status.
If the TPSP did not undergo a PCI DSS
assessment, it may be able to provide other
sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it has met
the applicable requirements without undergoing a
formal compliance validation. For example, the
TPSP can provide specific evidence to the entity’s
assessor so the assessor can confirm applicable
requirements are met. Alternatively, the TPSP
can elect to undergo multiple on-demand
assessments by each of its customers’ assessors,
with each assessment targeted to confirm that
applicable requirements are met.

providers, refer to:

```
12.8.4 A program is implemented to monitor TPSPs’
PCI DSS compliance status at least once every 12
months.
```
```
12.8.4.a Examine policies and procedures to verify
that processes are defined to monitor TPSPs’ PCI
DSS compliance status at least once every 12
months.
```
```
12.8.4.b Examine documentation and interview
responsible personnel to verify that the PCI DSS
compliance status of each TPSP is monitored at
```
**Customized Approach Objective** (^) least once every 12 months.
The PCI DSS compliance status of TPSPs is
verified periodically.
**Applicability Notes**
Where an entity has an agreement with a TPSP for
meeting PCI DSS requirements on behalf of the
entity (for example, via a firewall service), the entity
must work with the TPSP to make sure the
applicable PCI DSS requirements are met. If the
TPSP does not meet those applicable PCI DSS
requirements, then those requirements are also “not
in place” for the entity.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
It is important that the entity understands which
PCI DSS requirements and sub-requirements its
TPSPs have agreed to meet, which requirements
are shared between the TPSP and the entity, and
for those that are shared, specifics about how the
requirements are shared and which entity is
responsible for meeting each sub-requirement.
Without this shared understanding, it is inevitable
that the entity and the TPSP will assume a given
PCI DSS sub-requirement is the responsibility of
the other party, and therefore that sub-
requirement may not be addressed at all.
The specific information an entity maintains will
depend on the particular agreement with their
providers, the type of service, etc. TPSPs may
define their PCI DSS responsibilities to be the
same for all their customers; otherwise, this
responsibility should be agreed upon by both the
entity and TPSP.
Good Practice
Entities can document these responsibilities via a
matrix that identifies all applicable PCI DSS
requirements and indicates for each requirement
whether the entity or TPSP is responsible for
meeting that requirement or whether it is a shared
responsibility. This type of document is often
referred to as a responsibility matrix.

12.8.5 Information is maintained about which PCI
DSS requirements are managed by each TPSP,
which are managed by the entity, and any that are
shared between the TPSP and the entity.

that processes are defined to maintain information
about which PCI DSS requirements are managed
by each TPSP, which are managed by the entity,

12.8.5.b Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify the entity maintains information
about which PCI DSS requirements are managed
by each TPSP, which are managed by the entity,
and any that are shared between both entities.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Records detailing the PCI DSS requirements and
related system components for which each TPSP is
solely or jointly responsible, are maintained and
reviewed periodically.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
It is also important for entities to understand
whether any TPSPs have “nested” relationships
with other TPSPs, meaning the primary TPSP
contracts with another TPSP(s) for the purposes
of providing a service. It is important to
understand whether the primary TPSP is relying
on the secondary TPSP(s) to achieve overall
compliance of a service, and how the primary
TPSP is monitoring performance of the service
and the PCI DSS compliance status of the
secondary TPSP(s). Note that it is the
responsibility of the primary TPSP to manage and
monitor any secondary TPSPs.

12.9 Third-party service providers (TPSPs) support their customers’ PCI DSS compliance.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
In conjunction with Requirement 12.8.2, this
requirement is intended to promote a consistent
level of understanding between TPSPs and their
customers about their applicable PCI DSS
responsibilities. The acknowledgment of the
TPSPs evidences their commitment to
maintaining proper security of account data that it
obtains from its clients.
The method by which the TPSP provides written
acknowledgment should be agreed between the
provider and its customers.
```
```
12.9.1 Additional requirement for service
providers only: TPSPs acknowledge in writing to
customers that they are responsible for the security
of account data the TPSP possesses or otherwise
stores, processes, or transmits on behalf of the
customer, or to the extent that they could impact the
security of the customer’s CDE.
```
```
12.9.1 Additional testing procedure for service
provider assessments only: Examine TPSP
policies, procedures, and templates used for
written agreements to verify processes are defined
for the TPSP to provide written acknowledgments
to customers in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
TPSPs formally acknowledge their security
responsibilities to their customers.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement applies only when the entity being
assessed is a service provider.
The exact wording of an acknowledgment will
depend on the agreement between the two parties,
the details of the service being provided, and the
responsibilities assigned to each party. The
acknowledgment does not have to include the exact
wording provided in this requirement.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
If a TPSP does not provide the necessary
information to enable its customers to meet their
security and compliance requirements, the
customers will not be able to protect cardholder
data nor meet their own contractual obligations.
Good Practice
If a TPSP has a PCI DSS Attestation of
Compliance (AOC), the expectation is that the
TPSP should provide that to customers upon
request to demonstrate their PCI DSS compliance
status.
If the TPSP did not undergo a PCI DSS

TPSPs should provide sufficient evidence to their
customers to verify that the scope of the TPSP’s
PCI DSS assessment covered the services
applicable to the customer and that the relevant
PCI DSS requirements were examined and
determined to be in place.

12.9.2 Additional requirement for service
providers only: TPSPs support their customers’
requests for information to meet Requirements
12.8.4 and 12.8.5 by providing the following upon
customer request:
```
- PCI DSS compliance status information for any
    service the TPSP performs on behalf of
    customers (Requirement 12.8.4).
- Information about which PCI DSS requirements
    are the responsibility of the TPSP and which are
    the responsibility of the customer, including any
    shared responsibilities (Requirement 12.8.5).

```

provider assessments only: Examine policies
and procedures to verify processes are defined for
the TPSPs to support customers’ request for
information to meet Requirements 12.8.4 and
12.8.5 in accordance with all elements specified in
this requirement.

This requirement applies only when the entity being
assessed is a service provider.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
TPSPs may define their PCI DSS responsibilities
to be the same for all their customers; otherwise,
this responsibility should be agreed upon by both
the customer and TPSP. It is important that the
customer understands which PCI DSS
requirements and sub-requirements its TPSPs
have agreed to meet, which requirements are
shared between the TPSP and the customer, and
for those that are shared, specifics about how the
requirements are shared and which entity is
responsible for meeting each sub-requirement. An
example of a way to document these
responsibilities is via a matrix that identifies all
applicable PCI DSS requirements and indicates
whether the customer or TPSP is responsible for
meeting that requirement or whether it is a shared
responsibility.

12.10 Suspected and confirmed security incidents that could impact the CDE are responded to immediately.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without a comprehensive incident response plan
that is properly disseminated, read, and
understood by the parties responsible, confusion
and lack of a unified response could create further
downtime for the business, unnecessary public
media exposure, as well as risk of financial and/or
reputational loss and legal liabilities.
Good Practice
The incident response plan should be thorough
and contain all the key elements for stakeholders
(for example, legal, communications) to allow the
entity to respond effectively in the event of a
breach that could impact account data. It is
important to keep the plan up to date with current
contact information of all individuals designated
as having a role in incident response. Other
relevant parties for notifications may include
customers, financial institutions (acquirers and
issuers), and business partners.
Entities should consider how to address all
compromises of data within the CDE in their
incident response plans, including to account
data, wireless encryption keys, encryption keys
used for transmission and storage or account
data or cardholder data, etc.
Examples
Legal requirements for reporting compromises
include those in most US states, the EU General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the
Personal Data Protection Act (Singapore).

12.10.1 An incident response plan exists and is
ready to be activated in the event of a suspected or
confirmed security incident. The plan includes, but is
not limited to:
```
- Roles, responsibilities, and communication and
    contact strategies in the event of a suspected or
    confirmed security incident, including notification
    of payment brands and acquirers, at a minimum.
- Incident response procedures with specific
    containment and mitigation activities for different
    types of incidents.
- Business recovery and continuity procedures.
- Data backup processes.
- Analysis of legal requirements for reporting
    compromises.
- Coverage and responses of all critical system
    components.
- Reference or inclusion of incident response
    procedures from the payment brands.

A comprehensive incident response plan that meets
card brand expectations is maintained.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Proper testing of the security incident response
plan can identify broken business processes and
ensure key steps are not missed, which could
result in increased exposure during an incident.
Periodic testing of the plan ensures that the
processes remain viable, as well as ensuring that
all relevant personnel in the organization are
familiar with the plan.
Good Practice
The test of the incident response plan can include
simulated incidents and the corresponding
responses in the form of a “table-top exercise”,
that include participation by relevant personnel. A
review of the incident and the quality of the
response can provide entities with the assurance
that all required elements are included in the plan.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
An incident could occur at any time, therefore if a
person who is trained in incident response and
familiar with the entity’s plan is available when an
incident is detected, the entity’s ability to correctly
respond to the incident is increased.
Good Practice
Often, specific personnel are designated to be
part of a security incident response team, with the
team having overall responsibility for responding
to incidents (perhaps on a rotating schedule
basis) and managing those incidents in
accordance with the plan. The incident response
team can consist of core members who are
permanently assigned or “on-demand” personnel
who may be called up as necessary, depending
on their expertise and the specifics of the incident.
Having available resources to respond quickly to
incidents minimizes disruption to the organization.
Examples of types of activity the team or
individuals should respond to include any
evidence of unauthorized activity, detection of
unauthorized wireless access points, critical IDS
alerts, and reports of unauthorized critical system
or content file changes.

Good Practice
The lessons-learned exercise should include all
levels of personnel. Although it is often included
as part of the review of the entire incident, it
should focus on how the entity’s response to the
incident could be improved.
It is important to not just consider elements of the
response that did not have the planned outcomes
but also to understand what worked well and
whether lessons from those elements that worked
well can be applied areas of the plan that didn’t.

### Appendix A1: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Multi-Tenant Service Providers

```
Sections
```
```
A1.1 Multi-tenant service providers protect and separate all customer environments and data.
A1.2 Multi-tenant service providers facilitate logging and incident response for all customers.
```
```
Overview
```
```
All service providers are responsible for meeting PCI DSS requirements for their own environments as applicable to the services offered to their customers. In
addition, multi-tenant service providers must meet the requirements in this Appendix.
Multi-tenant service providers are a type of third-party service provider that offers various shared services to merchants and other service providers, where
customers share system resources (such as physical or virtual servers), infrastructure, applications (including Software as a Service (SaaS)), and/or databases.
Services may include, but are not limited to, hosting multiple entities on a single shared server, providing e-commerce and/or “shopping cart” services, web-
based hosting services, payment applications, various cloud applications and services, and connections to payment gateways and processors.
Service providers that provide only shared data center services (often called co-location or “co-lo” providers), where equipment, space, and bandwidth are
available on a rental basis, are not considered multi-tenant service providers for purposes of this Appendix.
Note : Even though a multi-tenant service provider may meet these requirements, each customer is still responsible to comply with the PCI DSS requirements
that are applicable to its environment and validate compliance as applicable. Often, there are PCI DSS requirements for which responsibility is shared between
the provider and the customer (for perhaps different aspects of the environment). Requirements 12.8 and 12.9 delineate requirements specific to the
relationships between all third-party service providers (TPSPs) and their customers, and the responsibilities of both. This includes defining the specific services
the customer is receiving, along with which PCI DSS requirements are the responsibility of the customer to meet, which are the responsibility of the TPSP, and
which requirements are shared between both customer and the TPSP.

within the provider’s environment could compromise
the customer’s environment, and similarly, a
malicious actor in a customer environment could
compromise the provider and potentially other of the
provider’s customers.
Multi-tenant environments should be isolated from
each other and from the provider’s infrastructure
such that they can be separately managed entities
with no connectivity between them.
Good Practice
Providers should ensure strong separation between
the environments that are designed for customer
access, for example, configuration and billing portals,
and the provider’s private environment that should
only be accessed by authorized provider personnel.
Service provider access to customer environments is
performed in accordance with requirement 8.2.3.

A1.1.1 Logical separation is implemented as
follows:
```
- The provider cannot access its customers’
    environments without authorization.
- Customers cannot access the provider’s
    environment without authorization.

```
A1.1.1 Examine documentation and system and
network configurations and interview personnel to

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
It is important that a multi-tenant service provider
define controls so that each customer can only
access their own environment and CDE to prevent
unauthorized access from one customer’s
environment to another.
Examples
In a cloud-based infrastructure, such as an
infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offering, the
customers’ CDE may include virtual network devices
and virtual servers that are configured and managed
by the customers, including operating systems, files,
memory, etc.
```
```
A1.1.2 Controls are implemented such that each
customer only has permission to access its own
cardholder data and CDE.
```
```
A1.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify controls
are defined such that each customer only has
permission to access its own cardholder data and
CDE.
```
```
A1.1.2.b Examine system configurations to verify
that customers have privileges established to only
Customized Approach Objective access their own account data and CDE.^
```
```
Customers cannot access other customers’
environments.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
To prevent any inadvertent or intentional impact to
other customers’ environments or account data, it is
important that each customer can access only
resources allocated to that customer.
```
```
A1.1.3 Controls are implemented such that each
customer can only access resources allocated to
them.
```
```
A1.1.3 Examine customer privileges to verify each
customer can only access resources allocated to
them.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Customers cannot impact resources allocated to
other customers.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Multi-tenant services providers are responsible for
managing the segmentation between their
customers.
Without technical assurance that segmentation
controls are effective, it is possible that changes to
the service provider’s technology would inadvertently
create a vulnerability that could be exploited across
all the service provider’s customers.
Good Practice
Effectiveness of separation techniques can be
confirmed by using service-provider-created
temporary (mock-up) environments that represent
customer environments and attempting to 1) access
one temporary environment from another
environment, and 2) access a temporary environment
from the Internet.
```
```
A1.1.4 The effectiveness of logical separation
controls used to separate customer
environments is confirmed at least once every
six months via penetration testing.
```
```
A1.1.4 Examine the results from the most recent
penetration test to verify that testing confirmed the
effectiveness of logical separation controls used to
separate customer environments.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Segmentation of customer environments from
other environments is periodically validated to be
effective.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
The testing of adequate separation between
customers in a multi-tenant service provider
environment is in addition to the penetration
tests specified in Requirement 11.4.6.

A1.2 Multi-tenant service providers facilitate logging and incident response for all customers.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Log information is useful for detecting and
troubleshooting security incidents and is invaluable
for forensic investigations. Customers therefore need
to have access to these logs.
However, log information can also be used by an
attacker for reconnaissance, and so a customer’s log
information must only be accessible by the customer
that the log relates to.
```
```
A1.2.1 Audit log capability is enabled for each
customer’s environment that is consistent with
PCI DSS Requirement 10, including:
```
- Logs are enabled for common third-party
    applications.
- Logs are active by default.
- Logs are available for review only by the
    owning customer.
- Log locations are clearly communicated to
    the owning customer.
- Log data and availability is consistent with
    PCI DSS Requirement 10.

```
A1.2.1 Examine documentation and system
configuration settings to verify the provider has
enabled audit log capability for each customer
environment in accordance with all elements
specified in this requirement.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
Log capability is available to all customers
without affecting the confidentiality of other
customers.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
In the event of a suspected or confirmed breach of
confidentiality of cardholder data, a customer’s
forensic investigator aims to find the cause of the
breach, exclude the attacker from the environment,
and ensure all unauthorized access is removed.
Prompt and efficient responses to forensic
investigators’ requests can significantly reduce the
time taken for the investigator to secure the
customer’s environment.

A1.2.2 Processes or mechanisms are
implemented to support and/or facilitate prompt
forensic investigations in the event of a
suspected or confirmed security incident for any
customer.
```
```
A1.2.2 Examine documented procedures to verify
that the provider has processes or mechanisms to
support and/or facilitate a prompt forensic
investigation of related servers in the event of a
suspected or confirmed security incident for any
customer.

```
Forensic investigation is readily available to all
customers in the event of a suspected or
confirmed security incident.

Security vulnerabilities in the provided services can
impact the security of all the service provider’s
customers and therefore must be managed in
accordance with the service provider’s established
processes, with priority given to resolving
vulnerabilities that have the highest probability of
compromise.
Customers are likely to notice vulnerabilities and
security misconfigurations while using the service.

### Appendix A2: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Entities Using SSL/Early TLS for Card-Present POS POI Terminal Connections

```
Sections
```
```
A2.1 POI terminals using SSL and/or early TLS are confirmed as not susceptible to known SSL/TLS exploits.
```
```
Overview
```
```
This Appendix applies only to entities using SSL/early TLS as a security control to protect POS POI terminals, including service providers that
provide connections into POS POI terminals.
```
```
Entities using SSL and early TLS for POS POI terminal connections must work toward upgrading to a strong cryptographic protocol as soon as
possible. Additionally, SSL and/or early TLS must not be introduced into environments where those protocols don’t already exist. At the time of
publication, the known vulnerabilities are difficult to exploit in POS POI payment terminals. However, new vulnerabilities could emerge at any
time, and it is up to the organization to remain up to date with vulnerability trends and determine whether it is susceptible to any known exploits.
```
```
The PCI DSS requirements directly affected are:
```
- **Requirement 2.2.5** : Where any insecure services, protocols, or daemons are present; business justification is documented, and additional
    security features are documented and implemented that reduce the risk of using insecure services, protocols, or daemons.
- **Requirement 2.2.7** : All non-console administrative access is encrypted using strong cryptography.
- **Requirement 4.2.1** : Strong cryptography and security protocols are implemented to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public
    networks.

```
SSL and early TLS must not be used as a security control to meet these requirements, except in the case of POS POI terminal connections, as
detailed in this appendix. To support entities working to migrate from SSL/early TLS on POS POI terminals, the following provisions are
included:
```
- New POS POI terminal implementations must not use SSL or early TLS as a security control.
- All POS POI terminal service providers must provide a secure service offering.
- Service providers supporting existing POS POI terminal implementations that use SSL and/or early TLS must have a formal Risk Mitigation
    and Migration Plan in place.
- POS POI terminals in card-present environments that can be verified as not being susceptible to any known exploits for SSL and early TLS,
    **and the SSL/TLS termination points to which they connect** , may continue using SSL/early TLS as a security control.

```
Requirements in this Appendix are not eligible for the Customized Approach.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
A2.1 POI terminals using SSL and/or early TLS are confirmed as not susceptible to known SSL/TLS exploits.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
POS POI terminals used in card-present
environments can continue using SSL/early TLS
when it can be shown that the POS POI terminal
is not susceptible to the currently known exploits.
Good Practice
However, SSL is outdated technology and could
be susceptible to additional security vulnerabilities
in the future; it is therefore strongly recommended
that POS POI terminals be upgraded to a secure
protocol as soon as possible. If SSL/early TLS is
not needed in the environment, use of, and
fallback to these versions should be disabled.
Further Information
Refer to the current PCI SSC Information
Supplements on SSL/Early TLS for further
guidance.
```
```
A2.1.1 Where POS POI terminals at the merchant
or payment acceptance location use SSL and/or
early TLS, the entity confirms the devices are not
susceptible to any known exploits for those
protocols.
```
```
A2.1.1 For POS POI terminals using SSL and/or
early TLS, confirm the entity has documentation (for
example, vendor documentation, system/network
configuration details) that verifies the devices are not
susceptible to any known exploits for SSL/early TLS.
```
```
Customized Approach Objective
```
```
This requirement is not eligible for the customized
approach.
```
```
Applicability Notes
```
```
This requirement is intended to apply to the entity
with the POS POI terminal, such as a merchant.
This requirement is not intended for service
providers who serve as the termination or
connection point to those POS POI terminals.
Requirements A2.1.2 and A2.1.3 apply to POS
POI service providers.
The allowance for POS POI terminals that are not
currently susceptible to exploits is based on
currently known risks. If new exploits are
introduced to which POS POI terminals are
susceptible, the POS POI terminals will need to be
updated immediately.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
POS POI termination points, including but not
limited to service providers such as acquirers or
acquirer processors, can continue using SSL/early
TLS when it can be shown that the service
provider has controls in place that mitigate the risk
of supporting those connections for the service
provider environment.
Good Practice
Service providers should communicate to all
customers using SSL/early TLS about the risks
associated with its use and the need to migrate to
a secure protocol.
Definitions
The Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan is a
document prepared by the entity that details its
plans for migrating to a secure protocol and
describes controls the entity has in place to
reduce the risk associated with SSL/early TLS
until the migration is complete.
Further Information
Refer to the current PCI SSC Information
Supplements on SSL/early TLS for further
guidance on Risk Mitigation and Migration Plans.
```
```
A2.1.2 Additional requirement for service
providers only: All service providers with existing
connection points to POS POI terminals that use
SSL and/or early TLS as defined in A2.1 have a
formal Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan in place
that includes:
```
- Description of usage, including what data is
    being transmitted, types and number of
    systems that use and/or support SSL/early
    TLS, and type of environment.
- Risk-assessment results and risk-reduction
    controls in place.
- Description of processes to monitor for new
    vulnerabilities associated with SSL/early TLS.
- Description of change control processes that
    are implemented to ensure SSL/early TLS is
    not implemented into new environments.
- Overview of migration project plan to replace
    SSL/early TLS at a future date.

```
A2.1.2 Additional testing procedure for service
provider assessments only: Review the
documented Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan to
verify it includes all elements specified in this
requirement.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Customers must be able to choose to upgrade
their POIs to eliminate the vulnerability in using
SSL and early TLS. In many cases, customers will
need to take a phased or gradual approach to
migrate their POS POI estate from the insecure
protocol to a secure protocol and so will require
the service provider to support a secure offering.

### Appendix A3: Designated Entities Supplemental Validation (DESV)

```
Sections
```
```
A3.1 A PCI DSS compliance program is implemented.
A3.2 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.
A3.3 PCI DSS is incorporated into business-as-usual (BAU) activities.
A3.4 Logical access to the cardholder data environment is controlled and managed.
A3.5 Suspicious events are identified and responded to.
```
```
Overview
```
```
This Appendix applies only to entities designated by a payment brand(s) or acquirer as requiring additional validation of existing PCI DSS
requirements. An entity is required to undergo an assessment according to this Appendix ONLY if instructed to do so by an acquirer or a
payment brand. Examples of entities that this Appendix could apply to include:
```
- Those storing, processing, and/or transmitting large volumes of account data,
- Those providing aggregation points for account data, or
- Those that have suffered significant or repeated breaches of account data.

```
Additionally, other PCI standards may reference completion of this Appendix.
```
```
These supplemental validation steps are intended to provide greater assurance that PCI DSS controls are maintained effectively and on a
continuous basis through validation of business-as-usual (BAU) processes and increased validation and scoping consideration.
```
```
Note : Some requirements have defined timeframes (for example, at least once every three months or at least once every six months) within
which certain activities are to be performed. For initial assessment to this document, it is not required that an activity has been performed for
every such timeframe during the previous year, if the assessor verifies:
```
- _The activity was performed in accordance with the applicable requirement within the most recent timeframe (for example, the most recent_
    _three-month or six-month period), and_
- _The entity has documented policies and procedures for continuing to perform the activity within the defined timeframe._

```
For subsequent years after the initial assessment, an activity must have been performed within each required timeframe (for example, an
activity required every three months must have been performed at least four times during the previous year at an interval that does not exceed
90 days).
```
```
Not all requirements in PCI DSS apply to all entities that may undergo a PCI DSS assessment. It is for this reason that some PCI DSS
Requirements are duplicated in this appendix. Any questions about this appendix should be addressed to acquirers or payment brands.

A3.1 A PCI DSS compliance program is implemented.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Executive management assignment of PCI DSS
compliance responsibilities ensures executive-
level visibility into the PCI DSS compliance
program and allows for the opportunity to ask
appropriate questions to determine the
effectiveness of the program and influence
strategic priorities.
Good Practice
Executive management may include C-level
positions, board of directors, or equivalent. The
specific titles will depend on the particular
organizational structure.
Responsibility for the PCI DSS compliance
program may be assigned to individual roles
and/or to business units within the organization.
```
```
A3.1.1 Responsibility is established by executive
management for the protection of account data and
a PCI DSS compliance program that includes:
```
- Overall accountability for maintaining PCI DSS
    compliance.
- Defining a charter for a PCI DSS compliance
    program.
- Providing updates to executive management and
    board of directors on PCI DSS compliance
    initiatives and issues, including remediation
    activities, at least once every 12 months.
**PCI DSS Reference** : _Requirement 12_

```
A3.1.1.a Examine documentation to verify
executive management has assigned overall
accountability for maintaining the entity’s PCI DSS
compliance.
```
```
A3.1.1.b Examine the company’s PCI DSS charter
to verify it outlines the conditions under which the
PCI DSS compliance program is organized.
```
```

```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
A formal compliance program allows an
organization to monitor the health of its security
controls, be proactive if a control fails, and
effectively communicate activities and compliance
status throughout the organization.
Good Practice
The PCI DSS compliance program can be a
dedicated program or part of overarching
compliance and/or governance program, and
should include a well-defined methodology that
demonstrates consistent and effective evaluation.
Strategic business decisions that should be
analyzed for potential PCI DSS impacts may
include mergers and acquisitions, new technology
purchases, or new payment-acceptance
channels.
Definitions
Maintaining and monitoring an organization’s
overall PCI DSS compliance includes identifying
activities to be performed daily, weekly, monthly,
every three months, or annually, and ensuring
these activities are being performed accordingly
(for example, using a security self-assessment or
PDCA methodology).
Examples
Methodologies that support the management of
compliance programs include Plan-Do-Check-Act
(PDCA), ISO 27001, COBIT, DMAIC, and Six
Sigma.
```
```
A3.1.2 A formal PCI DSS compliance program is in
place that includes:
```
- Definition of activities for maintaining and
    monitoring overall PCI DSS compliance,
    including business-as-usual activities.
- Annual PCI DSS assessment processes.
- Processes for the continuous validation of PCI
    DSS requirements (for example, daily, weekly,
    every three months, as applicable per the
    requirement).
- A process for performing business-impact
    analysis to determine potential PCI DSS impacts
    for strategic business decisions.
**PCI DSS Reference** : _Requirements 1- 12_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The formal definition of specific PCI DSS
compliance roles and responsibilities helps to
ensure accountability and monitoring of ongoing
PCI DSS compliance efforts.
Good Practice
Ownership should be assigned to individuals with
the authority to make risk-based decisions, and
upon whom accountability rests for the specific
function. Duties should be formally defined, and
owners should be able to demonstrate an
understanding of their responsibilities and
accountability.
Compliance roles may be assigned to a single
owner or multiple owners for different requirement
elements.
```
```
A3.1.3 PCI DSS compliance roles and
responsibilities are specifically defined and formally
assigned to one or more personnel, including:
```
- Managing PCI DSS business-as-usual activities.
- Managing annual PCI DSS assessments.
- Managing continuous validation of PCI DSS
    requirements (for example, daily, weekly, every
    three months, as applicable per the
    requirement).
- Managing business-impact analysis to determine
    potential PCI DSS impacts for strategic business
    decisions.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Personnel responsible for PCI DSS compliance
have specific training needs exceeding that which
is typically provided by general security
awareness training to enable them to perform
their role.
Good Practice
Individuals with PCI DSS compliance
responsibilities should receive specialized training
that, in addition to a general awareness of
information security, focuses on specific security
topics, skills, processes, or methodologies that
must be followed for those individuals to perform
their compliance responsibilities effectively.
Training may be offered by third parties such as
the PCI SSC (for example, PCI Awareness, PCIP,
and ISA), payment brands, and acquirers, or
training may be internal. Training content should
be applicable for the individual’s job function, be
current, and include the latest security threats
and/or version of PCI DSS.

```
A3.2 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Frequent validation of PCI DSS scope helps to
ensure PCI DSS scope remains up to date and
aligned with changing business objectives, and
therefore that security controls are protecting all
appropriate system components.
Good Practice
Accurate scoping involves critically evaluating the
CDE and all connected system components to
determine the necessary coverage for PCI DSS
requirements. Scoping activities, including careful
analysis and ongoing monitoring, help to ensure
that in-scope systems are appropriately secured.
When documenting account data locations, the
entity can consider creating a table or
spreadsheet that includes the following
information:
```
- Data stores (databases, files, cloud, etc.),
    including purpose of data storage and the
    retention period,
- Which CHD elements are stored (PAN, expiry
    date, cardholder name, and/or any elements of
    SAD prior to completion of authorization),
- How data is secured (type of encryption and
    strength, hashing algorithm and strength,
    truncation, tokenization),
- How access to data stores is logged, including
    a description of logging mechanism(s) in use
    (enterprise solution, application level,
    operating system level, etc.).
_(continued on next page)_

```
A3.2.1 PCI DSS scope is documented and
confirmed for accuracy at least once every three
months and upon significant changes to the in-
scope environment. At a minimum, the scoping
validation includes:
```
- Identifying all data flows for the various payment
    stages (for example, authorization, capture,
    settlement, chargebacks, and refunds) and
    acceptance channels (for example, card-present,
    card-not-present, and e-commerce).
- Updating all data-flow diagrams per
    Requirement 1.2.4.
- Identifying all locations where account data is
    stored, processed, and transmitted, including but
    not limited to 1) any locations outside of the
    currently defined CDE, 2) applications that
    process CHD, 3) transmissions between
    systems and networks, and 4) file backups.
- For any account data found outside of the
    currently defined CDE, either 1) securely delete
    it, 2) migrate it into the currently defined CDE, or
    3) expand the currently defined CDE to include
    it.
- Identifying all system components in the CDE,
    connected to the CDE, or that could impact
    security of the CDE.
- Identifying all segmentation controls in use and

Requirements, Requirement 12._

```
In addition to internal systems and networks, all
connections from third-party entities—for
example, business partners, entities providing
remote support services, and other service
providers—need to be identified to determine
inclusion for PCI DSS scope. Once the in-scope
connections have been identified, the applicable
PCI DSS controls can be implemented to reduce
the risk of a third-party connection being used to
compromise an entity’s CDE.
A data discovery tool or methodology can be used
to facilitate identifying all sources and locations of
PAN, and to look for PAN that resides on systems
and networks outside the currently defined CDE
or in unexpected places within the defined CDE—
for example, in an error log or memory dump file.
This approach can help ensure that previously
unknown locations of PAN are detected and that
the PAN is either eliminated or properly secured.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Changes to systems or networks can have a
significant impact on PCI DSS scope. For
example, changes to network security control
rulesets can bring whole network segments into
scope, or new systems may be added to the CDE
that have to be appropriately protected.
A formal impact assessment performed in
advance of a change gives the entity assurance
that the change will not adversely affect the
security of the CDE.
Good Practice
Processes to determine the potential impact that
changes to systems and networks may have on
an entity’s PCI DSS scope may be performed as
part of a dedicated PCI DSS compliance program
or may fall under an entity’s overarching
compliance and/or governance program.
```
```
A3.2.2 PCI DSS scope impact for all changes to
systems or networks is determined, including
additions of new systems and new network
connections. Processes include:
```
- Performing a formal PCI DSS impact
    assessment.
- Identifying applicable PCI DSS requirements to
    the system or network.
- Updating PCI DSS scope as appropriate.
- Documented sign-off of the results of the impact
    assessment by responsible personnel (as
    defined in A3.1.3).

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
It is important to have processes to analyze all
changes made to systems or networks, to ensure
that all appropriate PCI DSS controls are applied
to any systems or networks added to the in-scope
environment due to a change.
Building this validation into change management
processes helps ensure that device inventories
and configuration standards are kept up to date,
and security controls are applied where needed.
Good Practice
A change management process should include
supporting evidence that PCI DSS requirements
are implemented or preserved through an iterative
process.
Examples
PCI DSS requirements that should be verified
include, but are not limited to:
```
- Network diagrams are updated to reflect
    changes.
- Systems are configured per configuration
    standards, with all default passwords changed
    and unnecessary services disabled.
- Systems are protected with required controls—
    for example, file integrity monitoring,
    anti-malware, patches, and audit logging.
- Sensitive authentication data is not stored, and
    that all account data storage is documented
    and incorporated into data-retention policy and
    procedures.
- New systems are included in the quarterly
    vulnerability scanning process.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
An organization’s structure and management
define the requirements and protocol for effective
and secure operations. Changes to this structure
could have negative effects to existing controls
and frameworks by reallocating or removing
resources that once supported PCI DSS controls
or inheriting new responsibilities that may not
have established controls in place. Therefore, it is
important to revisit PCI DSS scope and controls
when there are changes to an organization’s
structure and management to ensure controls are
in place and active.
Examples
Changes to organizational structure include, but
are not limited to, company mergers or
acquisitions, and significant changes or
reassignments of personnel with responsibility for
security control.
```

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
PCI DSS normally requires segmentation controls
to be verified by penetration testing every twelve
months.
Validating segmentation controls more frequently
is likely to discover failings in segmentation before
they can be exploited by an attacker attempting to
pivot laterally from an out-of-scope untrusted
network to the CDE.
Good Practice
Although the requirement specifies that this scope
validation is carried out at least once every six
months and after a significant change, this
exercise should be performed as frequently as
possible to ensure it remains effective at isolating
the CDE from other networks.
Further Information
Refer to Information Supplement: Penetration
Testing Guidance for additional guidance.
```
```
A3.2.4 If segmentation is used, PCI DSS scope is
confirmed as follows:
```
- Per the entity’s methodology defined at
    Requirement 11.4.1.
- Penetration testing is performed on
    segmentation controls at least once every six
    months and after any changes to segmentation
    controls/methods.
- The penetration testing covers all segmentation
    controls/methods in use.
- The penetration testing verifies that
    segmentation controls/methods are operational
    and effective, and isolate the CDE from all out-
    of-scope systems.

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
PCI DSS requires that, as part of the scoping
exercise, assessed entities must identify and
document the existence of all cleartext PAN in
their environments. Implementing a data-
discovery methodology that identifies all sources
and locations of cleartext PAN and looks for
cleartext PAN on systems and networks outside
the currently defined CDE or in unexpected
places within the defined CDE—for example, in
an error log or memory dump file— helps to
ensure that previously unknown locations of
cleartext PAN are detected and properly secured.
Examples
A data-discovery process can be performed via a
variety of methods, including, but not limited to 1)
commercially available data-discovery software,
2) an in-house developed data-discovery
program, or 3) a manual search. A combination of
methodologies may also be used as needed.
Regardless of the method used, the goal of the
effort is to find all sources and locations of
cleartext PAN (not just in the defined CDE).
```
```
A3.2.5 A data-discovery methodology is
implemented that:
```
- Confirms PCI DSS scope.
- Locates all sources and locations of cleartext
    PAN at least once every three months and
    upon significant changes to the CDE or
    processes.
- Addresses the potential for cleartext PAN to
    reside on systems and networks outside the
    currently defined CDE.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
A process to test the effectiveness of the methods
used for data discovery ensures the
completeness and accuracy of account data
detection.
Good Practice
For completeness, system components in the in-
scope networks, and systems in out-of-scope
networks, should be included in the data-
discovery process.
The data-discovery process should be effective
on all operating systems and platforms in use.
Accuracy can be tested by placing test PANs on
system components and file formats in use and
confirming that the data-discovery method
detected the test PANs.
```
```
A3.2.5.1 Data discovery methods are confirmed as
follows:
```
- Effectiveness of methods is tested.
- Methods are able to discover cleartext PAN on
    all types of system components and file formats
    in use.
- The effectiveness of data-discovery methods is
    confirmed at least once every 12 months.

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Having documented response procedures that are
followed in the event cleartext PAN is found
outside the CDE helps to identify the necessary
remediation actions and prevent future leaks.
Good Practice
If PAN was found outside the CDE, an analysis
should be performed to 1) determine whether it
was saved independently of other data or with
sensitive authentication data, 2) to identify the
source of the data, and 3) identify the control gaps
that resulted in the data being outside the CDE.
Entities should consider whether contributory
factors, such as business processes, user
behavior, improper system configurations, etc.,
caused the PAN to be stored in an unexpected
location. If such contributory factors are present,
they should be addressed per this Requirement to
prevent a recurrence.
```
```
A3.2.5.2 Response procedures are implemented to
be initiated upon the detection of cleartext PAN
outside the CDE to include:
```
- Determining what to do if cleartext PAN is
    discovered outside the CDE, including its
    retrieval, secure deletion, and/or migration into
    the currently defined CDE, as applicable.
- Determining how the data ended up outside the
    CDE.
- Remediating data leaks or process gaps that
    resulted in the data being outside the CDE.
- Identifying the source of the data.
- Identifying whether any track data is stored with
    the PANs.

```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Without formal processes for the prompt (as soon
as possible) detection, alerting, and addressing of
critical security control failures, failures may go
undetected or remain unresolved for extended
periods. In addition, without formalized time-
bound processes, attackers will have ample time
to compromise systems and steal account data
from the CDE.
Good Practice
The specific types of failures may vary, depending
on the function of the device system component
and technology in use. Typical failures include a
system ceasing to perform its security function or
not functioning in its intended manner, such as a
firewall erasing all its rules or going offline.
```
```
A3.3.1 Failures of critical security control systems

If alerts from failures of critical security control
systems are not responded to quickly and
effectively, attackers may use this time to insert
malicious software, gain control of a system, or
steal data from the entity’s environment.
Good Practice
Documented evidence (for example, records

Hardware and software technologies are
constantly evolving, and organizations need to be
aware of changes to the technologies they use, as
well as the evolving threats to those technologies.
Conducting appropriate reviews of these

and manage, vulnerabilities in hardware and
software that will not be remediated by the vendor
or developer.
Good Practice
Organizations should also consider reviewing
firmware versions to ensure they remain current
and supported by the vendors.
Organizations also need to be aware of changes
made by technology vendors to their products or
processes to understand how such changes may
impact the organization’s use of the technology.
Regular reviews of technologies that impact or
influence PCI DSS controls can assist with
purchasing, usage, and deployment strategies

Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Regularly confirming that security policies and

assurance that the expected controls are active
and working as intended. The objective of these
reviews is not to reperform other PCI DSS
requirements, but to confirm that security activities
are being performed on an ongoing basis.
Good Practice
These reviews can also be used to verify that
appropriate evidence is being maintained—for
example, audit logs, vulnerability scan reports,
reviews of network security control rulesets—to
assist in the entity’s preparation for its next PCI
DSS assessment.
Examples
Looking at Requirement 1.2.7 as one example,
Requirement A3.3.3 is met by confirming, at least
once every three months, that reviews of
configurations of network security controls have
occurred at the required frequency. On the other
hand, Requirement 1.2.7 is met by reviewing
those configurations as specified in the
requirement.

- Confirmation that all BAU activities, including
    A3.2.2, A3.2.6, and A3.3.1, are being performed.
- Confirmation that personnel are following
    security policies and operational procedures (for
    example, daily log reviews, ruleset reviews for
    network security controls, configuration
    standards for new systems).
- Documenting how the reviews were completed,
    including how all BAU activities were verified as
    being in place.
- Collection of documented evidence as required
    for the annual PCI DSS assessment.
- Review and sign-off of results by personnel
    assigned responsibility for the PCI DSS
    compliance program, as identified in A3.1.3.
- Retention of records and documentation for at

```
A3.4 Logical access to the cardholder data environment is controlled and managed.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
Regular review of access rights helps to detect
excessive access rights remaining after user job
responsibilities change, system functions change,
or other modifications. If excessive user rights are
not revoked in due time, they may be used by
malicious users for unauthorized access.
This review provides another opportunity to
ensure that accounts for all terminated users have
been removed (if any were missed at the time of
termination), as well as to ensure that any third
parties that no longer need access have had their
access terminated.
```
```
A3.4.1 User accounts and access privileges to in-
scope system components are reviewed at least
once every six months to ensure user accounts and
access privileges remain appropriate based on job
function, and that all access is authorized.
PCI DSS Reference : Requirement 7
```
```
A3.4.1 Interview responsible personnel and
examine supporting documentation to verify that:
```
- User accounts and access privileges are
    reviewed at least every six months.
- Reviews confirm that access is appropriate
    based on job function and that all access is
    authorized.

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
A3.5 Suspicious events are identified and responded to.
```
```
Defined Approach Requirements Defined Approach Testing Procedures Purpose^
The ability to identify attack patterns and
undesirable behavior across systems—for
example, using centrally managed or automated
log-correlation tools— is critical in preventing,
detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data
compromise. The presence of logs in all
environments allows thorough tracking, alerting,
and analysis when something goes wrong.
Determining the cause of a compromise is very
difficult, if not impossible, without a process to
corroborate information from critical system
components and systems that perform security
functions, such as network security controls,
IDS/IPS, and file integrity monitoring (FIM)
systems. Thus, logs for all critical system
components and systems that perform security
functions need to be collected, correlated, and
maintained. This could include using software
products and service methodologies to provide
real-time analysis, alerting, and reporting, such as
security information and event management
(SIEM), FIM, or change detection.
```
```
A3.5.1 A methodology is implemented for the
prompt identification of attack patterns and
undesirable behavior across systems that includes:
```
- Identification of anomalies or suspicious activity
    as it occurs.
- Issuance of prompt alerts upon detection of
    suspicious activity or anomaly to responsible
    personnel.
- Response to alerts in accordance with
    documented response procedures.
**PCI DSS Reference** : _Requirements 10, 12_

```
A3.5.1.a Examine documentation and interview
personnel to verify a methodology is defined and
implemented to identify attack patterns and
undesirable behavior across systems in a prompt
manner, and includes all elements specified in this
requirement.
```
```
A3.5.1.b Examine incident response procedures
and interview responsible personnel to verify that:
```
- On-call personnel receive prompt alerts.
- Alerts are responded to per documented
    response procedures.

## Appendix B Compensating Controls

```
Compensating controls may be considered when an entity cannot meet a PCI DSS requirement explicitly as stated, due to legitimate and
documented technical or business constraints but has sufficiently mitigated the risk associated with the requirement through implementation of
other, or compensating, controls.
```
```
Compensating controls must satisfy the following criteria:
```
1. Meet the intent and rigor of the original PCI DSS requirement.
2. Provide a similar level of defense as the original PCI DSS requirement, such that the compensating control sufficiently offsets the risk
    that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to defend against. To understand the intent of a requirement, see _the Customized_
    _Approach Objective_ for most PCI DSS requirements. If a requirement is not eligible for the Customized Approach and therefore does not
    have a Customized Approach Objective, refer to the **Purpose** in the Guidance column for that requirement.
3. Be “above and beyond” other PCI DSS requirements. (Simply being in compliance with other PCI DSS requirements is not a
    compensating control.)
4. When evaluating “above and beyond” for compensating controls, consider the following:

```
Note: All compensating controls must be reviewed and validated for sufficiency by the assessor who conducts the PCI DSS
assessment. The effectiveness of a compensating control is dependent on the specifics of the environment in which the control is
implemented, the surrounding security controls, and the configuration of the control. Entities should be aware that a given compensating
control will not be effective in all environments.
```
```
a. Existing PCI DSS requirements CANNOT be considered as compensating controls if they are already required for the item under
review. For example, passwords for non-console administrative access must be sent encrypted to mitigate the risk of intercepting
cleartext administrative passwords. An entity cannot use other PCI DSS password requirements (intruder lockout, complex
passwords, etc.) to compensate for lack of encrypted passwords, since those other password requirements do not mitigate the risk
of interception of cleartext passwords. Also, the other password controls are already PCI DSS requirements for the item under
review (passwords).
```
```
b. Existing PCI DSS requirements MAY be considered as compensating controls if they are required for another area but are not
required for the item under review.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
c. Existing PCI DSS requirements may be combined with new controls to become a compensating control. For example, if a company
is unable to address a vulnerability that is exploitable through a network interface because a security update is not yet available
from a vendor, a compensating control could consist of controls that include all of the following: 1) internal network segmentation, 2)
limiting network access to the vulnerable interface to only required devices (IP address or MAC address filtering), and 3) IDS/IPS
monitoring of all traffic destined to the vulnerable interface.
```
5. Address the additional risk imposed by not adhering to the PCI DSS requirement.
6. Address the requirement currently and in the future. A compensating control cannot address a requirement that was missed in the past
    (for example, where performance of a task was required two quarters ago, but that task was not performed).

```
The assessor is required to thoroughly evaluate compensating controls during each annual PCI DSS assessment to confirm that each
compensating control adequately addresses the risk that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to address, per items 1-6 above.
```
```
To maintain compliance, processes and controls must be in place to ensure compensating controls remain effective after the assessment is
complete. Additionally, compensating control results must be documented in the applicable report for the assessment (for example, a Report
on Compliance or a Self-Assessment Questionnaire) in the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section, and included when the applicable
report is submitted to the requesting organization.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

## Appendix C Compensating Controls Worksheet

```
The entity must use this worksheet to define compensating controls for any requirement where compensating controls are used to meet a PCI
DSS requirement. Note that compensating controls should also be documented in accordance with instructions in the Report on Compliance in
the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section.
```
```
Note: Only entities that have legitimate and documented technological or business constraints can consider the use of compensating controls
to achieve compliance.
```
**Requirement Number and Definition:**

```
Information Required Explanation
```
**1. Constraints** Document the legitimate technical or business
    constraints precluding compliance with the
    original requirement.
**2. Definition of Compensating Controls** Define the compensating controls: explain how
    they address the objectives of the original
    control and the increased risk, if any.
**3. Objective** Define the objective of the original control (for
    example, the Customized Approach Objective).

```
Identify the objective met by the compensating
control (note: this can be, but is not required to
be, the stated Customized Approach Objective
for the PCI DSS requirement).
```
**4. Identified Risk** Identify any additional risk posed by the lack of
    the original control.
**5. Validation of Compensating Controls** Define how the compensating controls were
    validated and tested.
**6. Maintenance** Define process(es) and controls in place to
    maintain compensating controls.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

## Appendix D Customized Approach

```
This approach is intended for entities that decide to meet a PCI DSS requirement’s stated Customized Approach Objective in a way that does
not strictly follow the defined requirement. The customized approach allows an entity to take a strategic approach to meeting a requirement’s
Customized Approach Objective, so it can determine and design the security controls needed to meet the objective in a manner unique for that
organization.
```
```
The entity implementing a customized approach must satisfy the following criteria:
```
```
 Document and maintain evidence about each customized control, including all information specified in the Controls Matrix Template in
Appendix E1.
```
```
 Perform and document a targeted risk analysis (PCI DSS Requirement 12.3.2) for each customized control, including all information
specified in the Targeted Risk Analysis Template in Appendix E2.
```
```
 Perform testing of each customized control to prove effectiveness, and document testing performed, methods used, what was tested,
when testing was performed, and results of testing in the controls matrix.
```
```
 Monitor and maintain evidence about the effectiveness of each customized control.
```
```
 Provide completed controls matrix(es), targeted risk analysis, testing evidence, and evidence of customized control effectiveness to its
assessor.
```
```
The assessor performing an assessment of customized controls must satisfy the following criteria:
```
```
 Review the entity’s controls matrix(es), targeted risk analysis, and evidence of control effectiveness to fully understand the customized
control(s) and to verify the entity meets all Customized Approach documentation and evidence requirements.
```
```
 Derive and document the appropriate testing procedures needed to conduct thorough testing of each customized control.
```
```
 Test each customized control to determine whether the entity’s implementation 1) meets the requirement’s Customized Approach
Objective and 2) results in an “in place” finding for the requirement.
```
```
 At all times, QSAs maintain independence requirements defined in the QSA Qualification Requirements. This means if a QSA is
involved in designing or implementing a customized control, that QSA does not also derive testing procedures for, assess, or assist with
the assessment of that customized control.
```
```
The entity and its assessor are expected to work together to ensure 1) they agree that the customized control(s) fully meets the customized
approach objective, 2) the assessor fully understands the customized control, and 3) the entity understands the derived testing the assessor
will perform.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

```
Use of the customized approach must be completed by a QSA or ISA and documented in accordance with instructions in the Report on
Compliance (ROC) Template and following the instructions in the FAQs for use with PCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template available on the PCI SSC
website.
```
```
Entities that complete a Self-Assessment Questionnaire are not eligible to use a customized approach; however, these entities may elect to
have a QSA or ISA perform their assessment and document it in a ROC Template.
```
```
The use of the customized approach may be regulated by organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment brands and
acquirers). Therefore, questions about use of a customized approach must be referred to those organizations, including, for example, whether
an entity is required to use a QSA, or may use an ISA to complete an assessment using the customized approach.
```
```
Note: Compensating controls are not an option with the customized approach. Because the customized approach allows an entity to
determine and design the controls needed to meet a requirement’s Customized Approach Objective, the entity is expected to effectively
implement the controls it designed for that requirement without needing to also implement alternate, compensating controls.
```

_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0 March 2022_

## Appendix E Sample Templates to Support Customized Approach

```
This appendix contains example templates for the controls matrix and a targeted risk analysis, to be documented by the entity as part of the
customized approach. These templates are examples of formats that could be used. While it is not required that entities follow the specific
formats provided in this appendix, the entity’s control matrix and targeted risk analysis must include all the information as defined in these
templates.
```
### E1 Sample Controls Matrix Template

```
The following is a sample controls matrix template that an entity may use to document their customized implementation.
```
```
As described in Appendix D: Customized Approach , entities using the customized approach must complete a controls matrix to provide details
for each implemented control that explain what is implemented, how the entity has determined that the controls meet the stated objective of a
PCI DSS requirement, how the control provides at least the equivalent level of protection as would be achieved by meeting the defined
requirement, and how the entity has assurance about the effectiveness of the control on an ongoing basis.
```
```
The assessor uses the information within each controls matrix to plan and prepare for the assessment.
```
```
This sample controls matrix template includes the minimum information to be documented by the entity and provided to the assessor for a
customized validation. While it is not required that this specific template be used, it is required that the entity’s customized approach
documentation includes all information defined in this template, and that the entity provides this exact information to its assessor.
```
```
The controls matrix does not replace the need for the assessor to independently develop appropriate testing procedures for
validating the implemented controls. The assessor must still perform the necessary testing to verify the controls meet the objective of the
requirement, are effective, and are properly maintained. The controls matrix also does not replace the reporting requirements for customized
validations as specified in the ROC Template.
```
```
The controls matrix must include at least the information in the following table.
```
```

```
```
What is the implemented control(s)? <Entity describes what the control is and what it does>
```
```
Where is the control(s) implemented? <Entity identifies locations of facilities and system components where control is
implemented and managed>
```
```
When is the control(s) performed? <Entity details how frequently the control is performed – for example, runs
continuously in real time or is scheduled to run at NN times and at XX intervals>
```
```
Who has overall responsibility and accountability for the control(s)? <Entity includes details of individual personnel/roles with responsibility and
accountability for this control>
```
```
Who is involved in managing, maintaining, and monitoring the
control(s)?
```
```
<Entity includes details of individual personnel/roles and/or teams, as applicable,
that manage, maintain, and monitor the control>
```
```
For each PCI DSS requirement the control(s) is used for, the entity provides details of the following:
```
```
Entity describes how the implemented control(s) meets the stated
Customized Approach Objective of the PCI DSS requirement.
```
```
<Entity describes how the control meets the stated customized approach
objective of the PCI DSS requirement, and summarizes related results>
```
```
Entity describes testing it performed and the results of that testing
that demonstrates the control(s) meets the objective of the applicable
requirement.
```
```
<Entity describes the testing it performed to prove the control meets the stated
objective of the PCI DSS requirement, and summarizes related results>
```
```
Entity briefly describes the results of the separate targeted risk
analysis it performed that explains the control(s) implemented and
describes how the results verify the control(s) provides at least an
equivalent level of protection as the defined approach for the
applicable PCI DSS requirement. See the separate Targeted Risk
Analysis Template for details on how to document this risk analysis.
```
```
<Entity briefly describes the results of its risk analysis for this control, which is

```
```
To be completed by the entity being assessed
```
```
Entity describes the measures it has implemented to ensure the
control(s) is maintained and its effectiveness is assured on an ongoing
basis. For example, how the entity monitors for control effectiveness,
how control failures are detected and responded to, and the actions
taken.
```
```
<Entity describes how it ensures the control is maintained and how the control's
effectiveness is assured.>
```
### E2 Sample Targeted Risk Analysis Template

```
The following is a sample targeted risk analysis template an entity may use for their customized implementation. While it is not required that an
entity follow this specific format, its customized approach documentation must include all the information defined in this template.
```
```
As described in Appendix D: Customized Approach and in accordance with PCI DSS Requirement 12.3.2, an entity using the customized
approach must provide a detailed targeted risk analysis for each requirement the entity is meeting with the customized approach. The risk
analysis defines the risk, evaluates the effect on security if the defined requirement is not met, and describes how the entity has determined
that the controls provide at least an equivalent level of protection as provided by the defined PCI DSS requirement.
```
```
The assessor uses the information in the targeted risk analysis to plan and prepare for the assessment.
```
```
In completing a targeted risk analysis for a customized approach, it is important to remember that:
```
```
 The asset being protected is the cardholder data that is stored, processed, or transmitted by
the entity.
```
```
 The threat actor is highly motivated and capable. The motivation and capability of threat actors
tends to increase in relation to the volume of cardholder data that a successful attack will
realize.
```
```
 The likelihood that an entity will be targeted by threat actors increases as the entity stores,
processes, or transmits greater volumes of cardholder data.
```
```
 The mischief is directly related to the objective. For example, if the objective is “malicious
software cannot execute”, the mischief is that malicious software executes; if the objective is “day-to-day responsibilities for performing
all the activities are allocated”, the mischief is that the responsibilities are not allocated.
```
```
Note: The term “mischief” as used
in this targeted risk analysis (for
example, in 1.3 in the table below)
refers to an occurrence or event
that negatively affects the security
posture of the entity. Examples of
this are the absence of a policy, the
failure to conduct a vulnerability
scan, or that malware executes in
the entity’s environment.
```

This sample targeted risk analysis template includes the minimum information to be documented by the entity and provided to the assessor for
a customized validation. While it is not required that this specific template be used, it is required that the entity’s customized approach
documentation include all information defined in this template, and that the entity provides this exact information to its assessor.
```

```
3.1 Describe the factors detailed in the Control Matrix
that affect the likelihood of the mischief occurring.
```
```
Entity describes:
```
- How successful the controls will be at preventing the mischief
- How the controls detailed in the Control Matrix reduce the likelihood of the mischief occurring

```
3.2 Describe the reasons the mischief may still occur
after the application of the customized control.
```
```
Entity describes:
```
- The typical reasons for the control to fail, the likelihood of this, and how could it be prevented
- How resilient the entity’s processes and systems are for detecting that the control(s) are not
    operating normally?
- How a threat actor could bypass this control – what steps would they need to take, how hard
    is it, would the threat actor be detected before the control failed? How has this been
    determined?

```
3.3 To what extent do the controls detailed in the
customized approach represent a change in the
likelihood of the mischief occurring when compared with
the defined approach requirement?

```
```
4.1.2 Number of PANs processed or
transmitted over a 12-month period
```
```
Total
```
```
4.2 Description of how the customized controls will
directly:
```
- Reduce the number of individual PANs compromised
    if a threat actor is successful, and/or
- Allow quicker notification of the PANs compromised
    to the card brands.

```
Impact to the payment ecosystem is directly related to the number of accounts compromised and
how quickly any compromised PANs can be blocked by the card issuer.
Entity describes how the customized controls achieve the following if any of the customized
controls:
```
- Reduce the volume of cardholder data that is stored, processed, or transmitted and therefore
    reduce what is available to a successful threat actor, and/or
- Decrease the time to detection, notification of compromised accounts, and containment of the
    threat actor.
**5. Risk approval and review**

```
5.1 I have reviewed the above risk analysis and I agree
that the use of the proposed customized approach as
detailed provides at least an equivalent level of protection
as the defined approach for the applicable PCI DSS
requirement.
```
```
A member of executive management must review and agree to the proposed customized
approach.
<Member of entity’s executive management signs that it reviewed and agreed to the customized
approach documented herein.>
```
```
5.2 This risk analysis must be reviewed and updated no
later than:
```
```
The risk analysis should be reviewed at least every twelve months and more frequently if the
customized approach itself is time limited (for example, because there is a planned change in
technology) or if other factors dictate a needed change. In the event of an unscheduled risk
review, detail the reason the review occurred.
<Entity indicates date the targeted risk analysis was reviewed and updated.>

## Appendix F Leveraging the PCI Software Security Framework to Support

## Requirement 6

```
PCI DSS Requirement 6 defines requirements for the development and maintenance of secure systems and software. Because the PCI SSC
Secure Software Standard and the Secure SLC Standard (collectively, the Software Security Framework) include rigorous software security
requirements, the use of bespoke and custom software that is developed and maintained in accordance with either standard can help the
entity to meet several requirements in PCI DSS Requirement 6 without having to perform additional detailed testing, and may also support use
of the Customized Approach for other requirements. For details, see Table 7.
```
```
Note : This support for meeting Requirement 6 applies only to software that is specifically developed and maintained in accordance with the
Secure Software Standard or the Secure SLC Standard; it does not extend to other software or system components in scope for
Requirement 6.

6 .5 Changes to all system components are
managed securely.
```
```
PCI DSS requirements/objectives apply as usual.
Software developed and maintained in accordance with the Secure SLC Standard may support the
customized approach for Requirement 6.5 objectives.
While use of software developed and maintained in accordance with the Secure SLC Standard provides
assurance that the vendor follows change management procedures during development of software and
related updates, the entity retains responsibility for ensuring that software and other changes to system
components are implemented into its production environment in accordance with PCI DSS requirements.
```
**_Use of Bespoke and Custom Software Developed and Maintained by a Secure SLC Qualified Vendor_**

```
When validating the use of software developed and maintained by a Secure SLC Qualified Vendor to meet PCI DSS Requirement 6.2 and
support the Customized Approach for Requirements 6.3 and 6.5, the assessor must confirm that the following is met:
```
```
 The software vendor has a current listing on the PCI SSC List of Secure SLC Qualified Vendors—that is, the validation has not expired.
```
```
 The software was developed and is being maintained using software lifecycle management practices that were assessed as part of the
software vendor’s validation.
```
```
 The entity is following the implementation guidance provided by the Secure SLC Qualified Vendor.
```
**_Use of Bespoke and Custom Software Developed in Accordance with the Secure SLC Standard_**

```
Entities that internally develop software solely for their use or that develop software for use by a single entity may choose to engage a Secure
SLC Assessor to assess their software lifecycle management practices against the Secure SLC Standard. The Secure SLC Assessor will
document the results of the assessment in a Secure SLC Report on Compliance (ROC) and a Secure SLC Attestation of Compliance (AOC).
```
```
Software that is developed and maintained following software lifecycle management practices provides the same support for PCI DSS
Requirement 6 as software developed and maintained by a Secure SLC Qualified Vendor, if those practices were assessed by a Secure SLC
Assessor and confirmed to meet the Secure SLC Standard requirements, with the results documented in a Secure SLC ROC and AOC.

Sensitive Area A sensitive area is typically a subset of the CDE and is any area that houses systems considered critical to the CDE. This includes
data centers, server rooms, back-office rooms at retail locations, and any area that concentrates or aggregates cardholder data
storage, processing, or transmission. Sensitive areas also include areas housing systems that manage or maintain the security of the
CDE (for example, those providing network security controls or that manage physical or logical security).
This excludes the areas where only point-of-sale terminals are present, such as the cashier areas in a retail store or call centers
where agents are taking payments.
```
```
Sensitive
Authentication Data
(SAD)
```
```
Security-related information used to authenticate cardholders and/or authorize payment card transactions. This information includes,
but is not limited to, card validation verification codes/values, full track data (from magnetic stripe or equivalent on a chip), PINs, and
PIN blocks.
```
```
Separation of Duties Practice of dividing steps in a function among multiple individuals, to prevent a single individual from subverting the process.
```
```
Service Code Three-digit or four-digit value in the magnetic-stripe that follows the expiration date of the payment card on the track data. It is used
for various things, such as defining service attributes, differentiating between international and national interchange, or identifying
usage restrictions.
```
```
Service Provider Business entity that is not a payment brand, directly involved in the processing, storage, or transmission of cardholder data on behalf
of another entity. This includes payment gateways, payment service providers (PSPs), and independent sales organizations (ISOs).
This also includes companies that provide services that control or could impact the security of cardholder data. Examples include
managed service providers that provide managed firewalls, IDS, and other services as well as hosting providers and other entities.
If an entity provides a service that involves only the provision of public network access—such as a telecommunications company
providing just the communication link—the entity would not be considered a service provider for that service (although they may be
considered a service provider for other services). See Multi-Tenant Service Provider and Third-Party Service Provider.

Strong Cryptography Cryptography is a method to protect data through a reversible encryption process, and is a foundational primitive used in many
security protocols and services. Strong cryptography is based on industry-tested and accepted algorithms along with key lengths that
provide a minimum of 112-bits of effective key strength and proper key-management practices.
Effective key strength can be shorter than the actual ‘bit’ length of the key, which can lead to algorithms with larger keys providing
lesser protection than algorithms with smaller actual, but larger effective, key sizes. It is recommended that all new implementations
use a minimum of 128-bits of effective key strength.
Examples of industry references on cryptographic algorithms and key lengths include:
```
- _NIST Special Publication 800-57 Part 1_ ,
- _BSI TR-02102-1_ ,
- _ECRYPT-CSA D5.4 Algorithms, Key Size and Protocols Report (2018)_ , and
- _ISO/IEC 18033 Encryption algorithms,_ and
- _ISO/IEC 14888-3:2-81 IT Security techniques – Digital signatures with appendix – Part 3: Discrete logarithm based mechanisms_.

```
System Components Any network devices, servers, computing devices, virtual components, or software included in or connected to the CDE, or that could
impact the security of the CDE.
```
```
System-level object Anything on a system component that is required for its operation, including but not limited to application executables and
configuration files, system configuration files, static and shared libraries and DLLs, system executables, device drivers and device
configuration files, and third-party components.

Targeted Risk
Analysis
```
```
For PCI DSS purposes, a risk analysis that focuses on a specific PCI DSS requirement(s) of interest, either because the requirement
allows flexibility (for example, as to frequency) or, for the Customized Approach, to explain how the entity assessed the risk and
determined the customized control meets the objective of a PCI DSS requirement.

Virtual Payment
Terminal
```
```
In the context of Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) C-VT, a virtual payment terminal is web-browser-based access to an acquirer,
processor, or third-party service provider website to authorize payment card transactions, where the merchant manually enters
payment card data through a web browser. Unlike physical terminals, virtual payment terminals do not read data directly from a
payment card. Because payment card transactions are entered manually, virtual payment terminals are typically used instead of
physical terminals in merchant environments with low transaction volumes.
```
```
Virtualization The logical abstraction of computing resources from physical and/or logical constraints. One common abstraction is referred to as
virtual machines or VMs, which takes the content of a physical machine and allows it to operate on different physical hardware and/or
along with other virtual machines on the same physical hardware. Other common abstractions include, but are not limited to,
containers, serverless computing, or microservices.
