	•	Action Required:
	•	Please ensure all evidence is collected, submitted to the SharePoint folder, and validated by our team prior to the deadline to avoid delays in the onboarding process.

	•	Submission Deadline:
	•	All Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and other required evidence must be submitted to the assigned SharePoint folder under your application name and validated before the assessment starts.
	•	Action Required:
	•	Ensure all evidence is submitted to the SharePoint folder and validated by the Internal Security Assessor (ISA) team prior to the deadline to avoid delays in the onboarding process.


•	Once the PCI Portal is open for the next assessment, you will be responsible for uploading all validated evidence from the SharePoint folder to the PCI Portal.
	•	Additionally, there will be supplementary questions in the PCI Portal that you will need to address as part of the assessment.


Note: These are the basic evidence items that need to be validated right now because your application is new and being onboarded into PCI. Once the PCI Portal is open, there will be additional questions to address, and further evidence will need to be uploaded into the portal.
