Below are the customized TRA templates for Requirement 8.6.3 and Requirement 11.3.1.1, using the original headings from the TRA file and adding sub-questions specific to each requirement. The goal is to ensure the information gathered allows the PCI team to provide precise and comprehensive answers.

TRA Template for Requirement 8.6.3

Requirement: Prevent unauthorized access to accounts by detecting and responding to suspicious login attempts.

1. Identify the Asset(s) being protected.
	•	What systems or applications are covered by this requirement?
	•	Are there high-risk accounts or privileged users associated with these assets?
	•	Are these systems integrated with centralized authentication mechanisms (e.g., Active Directory, Okta)?

2. Identify the threat(s) that the requirement is protecting against.
	•	What are the potential unauthorized login methods or attack vectors (e.g., brute force, phishing, session hijacking)?
	•	Have these threats been observed in the environment in the past?
	•	Are there known threat actors or external entities that target similar systems?

3. Identify the factor(s) that contribute to the likelihood and/or impact of the threat being realized.
	•	Are there specific times or conditions (e.g., after a breach elsewhere) when login attempts increase?
	•	How robust are the implemented monitoring systems for detecting anomalies (e.g., failed login attempts)?
	•	What would be the operational or financial impact if an unauthorized login attempt succeeded?

4. Describe the analysis of and justification for how frequently the requirement must be performed to minimize the likelihood of the threat being realized.
	•	How often are login logs reviewed for anomalies or suspicious activity?
	•	What is the process for analyzing and validating flagged login attempts as potential threats?
	•	Is the detection system configured to provide real-time alerts for suspicious behavior?

5. Is an updated analysis needed, based on an annual review?
	•	How frequently is the effectiveness of the suspicious login monitoring mechanism reviewed?
	•	Are the latest threat patterns and attack methods incorporated into the analysis?

6. Are there defined and documented policies and procedures for performing the entity’s targeted risk analyses (TRA) consistently?
	•	Are policies and procedures available for monitoring, detecting, and responding to suspicious logins?
	•	Is training provided to administrators and end-users on secure login practices and monitoring alerts?

TRA Template for Requirement 11.3.1.1

Requirement: Perform external and internal vulnerability scans at least quarterly or after any significant change in the network.

1. Identify the Asset(s) being protected.
	•	What external and internal systems are included in the scope for vulnerability scans?
	•	Are any systems excluded from scanning? If so, what is the rationale?
	•	Are scanning tools configured to cover the full scope of in-scope assets?

2. Identify the threat(s) that the requirement is protecting against.
	•	What types of vulnerabilities are most commonly targeted in the industry or your environment?
	•	Are there past instances where unpatched vulnerabilities led to security incidents?
	•	How do emerging threats, such as zero-day vulnerabilities, factor into the threat landscape?

3. Identify the factor(s) that contribute to the likelihood and/or impact of the threat being realized.
	•	How frequently are high or critical vulnerabilities discovered during scans?
	•	What would be the impact if a critical vulnerability were exploited before remediation?
	•	Are there any external factors (e.g., regulatory scrutiny) that increase the impact of vulnerabilities?

4. Describe the analysis of and justification for how frequently the requirement must be performed to minimize the likelihood of the threat being realized.
	•	What is the frequency of routine vulnerability scans, and is it aligned with your risk exposure?
	•	How quickly are scans performed after significant changes (e.g., system upgrades, new integrations)?
	•	Are there additional manual or automated checks conducted between quarterly scans?

5. Is an updated analysis needed, based on an annual review?
	•	Is the frequency of vulnerability scans adjusted based on the latest risk assessments?
	•	Are lessons learned from past incidents or audits used to refine the scanning process?

6. Are there defined and documented policies and procedures for performing the entity’s targeted risk analyses (TRA) consistently?
	•	Are the scanning processes and remediation workflows documented and regularly reviewed?
	•	Is there a defined escalation process for addressing vulnerabilities that remain unresolved beyond the agreed timeline?

This structure combines the standard TRA questions with sub-questions tailored to each requirement to help gather precise information. Would you like me to refine further or add specific examples for better clarity?
