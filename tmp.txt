Title: Why Your Application is in PCI Scope

	•	How Applications are Flagged:
	•	Applications are identified as PCI in scope within ServiceNow and CMDB.
	•	A monthly report is pulled to identify any newly installed PCI applications.
	•	Scoping Criteria:
	•	To be in PCI scope, the following must apply:
	1.	PCI status must be Yes.
	2.	PCI Category should be 1 (in-scope for handling cardholder data).
	3.	Host Type must be SaaS with one of the following internal hosting options:
	•	ABC Dallas (Internally hosted)
	•	ABC Dallas PCF
	•	Check Your Application:
	•	Verify if your application is in scope by reviewing the list in this [Excel File URL] (Insert URL to the file containing the list of in-scope applications).
	•	Ensure your application is listed; if it is, proceed with the PCI onboarding requirements.
	•	If Your Application is Not in Scope:
	•	If you believe your application should not be in scope for this assessment, please contact Hasan for further clarification.



•	Check Your Application’s PCI Status:
	•	To determine whether your application is in PCI scope, refer to the [Excel File] that lists all applications currently flagged as PCI in scope (insert link).
	•	This file contains a detailed list of applications that have met the scoping criteria mentioned above. Application teams should review the file to verify whether their application is included.
	•	If your application is listed in this document, it means your application is subject to PCI assessment, and you must proceed with the onboarding and compliance requirements.
	•	In case your application is not listed, but you believe it should be, or if you feel your application has been incorrectly flagged as PCI in scope, please reach out to Hasan for clarification or further steps.
